  <h2 class='c009'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The history of Roman Classical Literature, although
it comprehends the names of many illustrious writers and
many voluminous works, is, chronologically speaking,
contained within narrow limits. Dating from its earliest
infancy, until the epoch when it ceased to deserve the
title of classical, its existence occupies a period of less
than four centuries.</p>

<p class='c011'>The imperial city had been founded for upwards of five
hundred years without exhibiting more than those rudest
germs of literary taste which are common to the most
uncivilized nations, without producing a single author
either in poetry or prose.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Roman mind, naturally vigorous and active, was
still uncultivated, when, about two centuries and a half
before the Christian era,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> conquest made the inhabitants
of the capital acquainted, for the first time, with Greek
science, art, and literature; and the last rays of classic
taste and learning ceased to illumine the Roman world
before the accession of the Antonines.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Such a history, however, must be introduced by a
reference to times of much higher antiquity.  The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>language itself must be examined historically, that is,
its progress and its formation from its primitive elements,
must be traced with reference to the influences exercised
upon it from without by the natives who spoke the dialects
out of which it was composed; and the earliest indications
of a taste for poetry, and a desire to cultivate
the intellectual powers, must be marked and followed out
in their successive stages of development. In this investigation,
it will be seen how great the difficulties were
with which literary men had to struggle under the Republic—difficulties
principally arising from the physical
activity of the people, and the practical character of the
Roman mind, which led the majority to undervalue and
despise devotion to sedentary and contemplative pursuits.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Roman, in the olden times, had a high and self-denying
sense of duty—he was ambitious, but his ambition
was for the glory, not of himself, but his country;
he thus lived for conquest: his motive, however, was not
self-aggrandizement but the extension of the domination
of Rome. When the state came to be merged in the
individual, generals and statesmen sought to heap up
wealth and to acquire power; but it was not so in the
Republican times. Owing to these characteristic features,
the Roman citizen conceived it to be his duty to devote
his energies to the public service: he concentrated all his
powers, mental and bodily, upon war and politics; he
despised all other occupations and sources of fame; for
he was conscious that his country owed her position
amongst nations to her military prowess, and her liberties
at home to the wise administration of her constitution.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_v'>v</span>Hence it will be seen, that there never was a period in
which literature did not require to be fostered and protected
by the patronage of the wealthy and powerful.
Even tragedy never captivated the feelings or acquired
an influence over the minds of the people at large as it
did in Greece; it degenerated into mere recitations in
a dramatic form, addressed like any other poetry to a
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coterie</span></i>. Comedy formed the only exception to this rule.
It was the only species of literature which the masses
thoroughly enjoyed. Learning was a sickly plant: patronage
was the artificial heat which brought it to maturity.
Accius was patronized by D. Brutus; Ennius
by Lucilius and the Scipios; Terence by Africanus and
Lælius; Lucretius by the Memmii; Tibullus by Messala;
Propertius by Ælius Gallus; Virgil and his friends
by Augustus, Mæcenas, and Pollio; Martial and Quintilian
by Domitian.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the conquest of Magna Græcia, Sicily, and, finally,
of Greece itself, first directed to the pursuit of intellectual
cultivation a people whose national literature, even if it
deserved to be so called, was of the rudest and most
meager description, Roman literature was, as might be
expected, the offspring of the Greek, and its beauties a
reflexion of the Greek mind; and although some portions
were more original than others, as being more congenial
to the national character—such, for example, as satire,
oratory, and history—it was, upon the whole, never
anything more than an imitation. It had, therefore,
all the faults of an imitation. As in painting, those that
study the old masters, and neglect nature, are nothing
more than copyists, however high the finish and elaborate
the polish of their works may be; so in the literature of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>Rome, we are delighted with the execution, and charmed
with the genius, wit, and ingenuity, but we seek in vain
for the enthusiasm and inspiration which breathes in
every part of the original.</p>

<p class='c011'>One faculty of the greatest importance to literary eminence
was possessed by the Romans in the highest perfection,
because it may be acquired as well as innate, and
is always improved and polished by education: that
faculty is taste—the ability, as Addison defines it, to
discern the beauties of an author with pleasure, and his
imperfections with dislike.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the three periods into which this history is divided,
the first may be considered as <i>dramatic</i>. Eloquence,
indeed, made rapid strides, and C. Gracchus may be
considered as the father of Latin prose; but the language
was not sufficiently smoothed and polished; the sentiments
of the orator were far superior to the diction in which
they were conveyed. Jurisprudence also was studied
with thoughtfulness and accuracy; history, however,
was nothing more than annals, and epic poetry rugged
and monotonous. But the acting tragedy of the Romans
is almost exclusively confined to this period; and the
comedies of Plautus and Terence were then written, which
have survived to command the admiration of modern
times. Although, at this epoch, the language was
elaborately polished and embellished with the utmost
variety of graceful forms and expressions, it was simple
and unconstrained: it flowed easily and naturally, and
was therefore full and copious; brevity and epigrammatic
terseness are acquired qualities, and the result of art,
although that art may be skilfully concealed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The second period consists of two subdivisions, of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>the first was the era of <i>prose</i>, and, consequently, the period
at which the language attained its greatest perfection;
for the structure, power, and genius of a language must
be judged of by its prose, and not by its poetry. Cicero
is the representative of this era as an orator and philosopher—Cæsar
and Sallust as historians. The second subdivision,
or the Augustan age, is the era of poetry, for in
it poetry arrived at the same eminence which prose had
attained in the preceding generation. But the age of
Cicero and that of Augustus can only be made subdivisions
of one great period; they are not separated from
each other by a strong line of demarkation; they are
blended together, and gradually melt into one another.
In the former, Lucretius and Catullus were the harbingers
of Virgil, Horace, and Ovid; and, in the latter,
the sun of Cicero, Cæsar, and Sallust, seems to set in the
sweet narrative of Livy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The last period is <i>rhetorical</i>: it has been called “the
silver age.” It produced Rome’s only fabulist, Phædrus;
the greatest satirist, Juvenal; the wittiest epigrammatist,
Martial; the most philosophical historian, Tacitus; the
most judicious critic, Quintilian; and a letter-writer,
scarcely inferior to Cicero himself, the younger Pliny;
and yet, notwithstanding these illustrious names, this
is the period of the decline. These great names shed
a lustre over their generation; but they did not influence
their taste or arrest the approaching decay of the national
genius: causes were at work which were rapidly producing
this effect, and they were beyond their control. A
new and false standard of taste was now set up, which
was inconsistent with original genius and independent
thought. Rome was persuaded, to accept a declamatory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>rhetoric as a substitute for that fervid eloquence in which
she had delighted, and which was now deprived of its
use, and was driven from the Forum to the lecture-room.
This taste infected every species of composition. Seneca
abused his fine talents to teach men to admire nothing
so much as glitter, novelty, and affectation; and, at length,
all became constrained, hollow, and artificial. With
the national liberty, the national intellect lapsed into
a state of inactivity: a period of intellectual darkness
succeeded, the influence which the capital had lost was
taken up by the provinces, and thus the way was paved
for the inroad of barbarism.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such is the outline of this work; and if the reader finds
some features, which he considers of great importance,
rapidly touched upon, the extent of the subject, and the
wish to compress it within a moderate compass, must be
offered as the author’s apology. In conclusion, the
author acknowledges his deep obligations to those historians
and biographers whose works he has consulted
during the composition of this history. He feels that
it would have been presumptuous to offer such a work
to the public without having profited by the laborious
investigations of Wolf, Bayle, Hermann, Grotefend,
Bernhardy, Bähr, Schlegel, Lachmann, Dunlop, Matthiæ,
Schoell, Krause, Ritter, Nisard, Pierron, Niebuhr,
Milman, Arnold, Merivale, Donaldson, Smith, and the
authors of the “<cite class='quote'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Biographie Universelle</span></cite>.”</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <span class='small'>COMPARISON OF THE LATIN LANGUAGE WITH THE GREEK—ERAS OF LATINITY—ORIGIN OF THE ROMANS—ELEMENTS OF THE LATIN LANGUAGE—ETRUSCAN INFLUENCE.</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>The various races which, from very remote antiquity, inhabited
the peninsula of Italy, necessarily gave a composite character to
the Latin language. But as all of them sprang from one common
origin, the great Indo-European stock to which also the
Hellenic family belonged, a relation of the most intimate kind
is visible between the languages of ancient Greece and Rome.
Not only are their alphabets and grammatical constructions identical,
but the genius of the one is so similar to that of the other,
that the Romans readily adopted the principles of Greek literary
taste, and Latin, without losing its own characteristic features,
moulded itself after the Greek model.</p>

<p class='c011'>Latin, however, has not the plastic property which the Greek
possesses—the natural faculty of transforming itself into every
variety of shape conceived by the fancy and imagination. It is
a harder material, it readily takes a polish, but the process by
which it receives it is laborious and artificial. Greek, like a
liquid or a soft substance, seems to crystallize as it were spontaneously
into the most beautiful forms: Latin, whether poetry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>or prose, derives only from consummate art and skill that graceful
beauty which is the natural property of the kindred language.</p>

<p class='c011'>Latin, also, to continue the same metaphor, has other characteristic
features of hard substances—gravity, solidity, and momentum
or energy. It is a fit language for embodying and expressing
the thoughts of an active and practical but not an imaginative
and speculative people.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the Latin language, notwithstanding its nervous energy
and constitutional vigour, has, by no means, exhibited the permanency
and vitality of the Greek. The Greek language, reckoning
from the earliest works extant to the present day, boasts
of an existence measured by nearly one-half the duration of the
human race, and yet how gradual were the changes during the
classical periods, and how small, when compared with those of
other European languages, the sum and result of them all! Setting
aside the differences due to race and physical organization,
there are no abrupt chasms, no broad lines of demarkation, between
one literary period and another. The transition is gentle,
slow, and gradual. The successive steps can be traced and
followed out. The literary style of one period melts and is absorbed
into that of the following one, just like the successive
tints and colours of the prism. The Greek of the Homeric
poems is not so different from that of Herodotus and Thucydides,
or the tragedians or the orators, or even the authors of
the later debased ages, but that the same scholar who understands
the one can analyze the rest. Though separated by so
many ages, the contemporaries of Demosthenes could appreciate
the beauties of Homer; and the Byzantines and early Christian
fathers wrote and spoke the language of the ancient Greek
philosophers.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Greek language long outlived Greek nationality. The
earliest Roman historians wrote in Greek because they had as
yet no native language fitter to express their thoughts. The
Romans, in the time of Cicero, made Greek the foundation of a
liberal education, and frequented Athens as a University for the
purpose of studying Greek literature and philosophy. The great
orator, in his defence of the poet Archias, informs us that Greek
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>literature was read by almost all nations of the world, whilst
Latin was still confined within very narrow boundaries. At the
commencement of the Christian era Greek was so prevalent
throughout the civilized world, that it was the language chosen
by the Evangelists for recording the doctrines of the gospel.
In the time of Hadrian, Greek was the favourite language of
literary men. The Princess Anna Comnena, daughter of the
Emperor Alexis, and Eustathius, the commentator on Homer,
both of whom nourished in the twelfth century after the birth
of Christ, are celebrated for the singular purity of their style;
and, lastly, Philelphus, who lived in the fifteenth century, and
had visited Constantinople, states, in a letter dated <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1451,
that although much bad Greek was spoken in that capital, the
court, and especially the ladies, retained the dignity and elegance
which characterize the purest writers of the classical ages.
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Græci quibus lingua depravata non sit, et quos ipsi tum sequimur
tum imitamur ita loquuntur vulgo etiam hac tempestate ut
Aristophanes comicus ut Euripides tragicus, ut oratores omnes
ut historiographi ut philosophi etiam ipsi et Plato et Aristoteles.
Viri aulici veterem sermonis dignitatem atque elegantiam retinebant.</span>”<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Such was the wonderful vitality of Greek in its ancient form;
and yet, strange to say, notwithstanding it clung so to existence,
it seems as though it was a plant of such delicate nature, that
it could only flourish under a combination of favourable circumstances.
It pined and withered when separated from the living
Greek intellect. It lived only where Greeks themselves lived,
in their fatherland or in their colonies. It refused to take root
elsewhere. Whenever in any part of the world a Greek settlement
decayed, and the population became extinct, even although
Greek art and science, and literature and philosophy, had found
there a temporary home, the language perished also.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Greek language could not exist when the fostering care
of native genius was withdrawn: it then shrunk back again into
its original dimensions, and was confined within the boundaries
of its original home. When the Greeks in any place passed
away, their language did not influence or amalgamate with that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>of the people which succeeded them. Latin, on the other hand,
was propagated like the dominion of Rome by conquest; it
either took the place of the language of the conquered nation,
or became engrafted upon it and gradually pervaded its composition.
Hence its presence is discernible in all European languages.
In Spain it became united with the Celtic and Iberian
as early as the period of the Gracchi: it was planted in Gaul
by the conquests of Julius Cæsar, and in Britain (so far as the
names of localities are concerned) by his transient expeditions;
and lastly, in the reign of Trajan, it became permanently fixed
in the distant regions of Dacia and Pannonia.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is scarcely correct to term Greek a dead language. It has
degenerated, but has never perished or disappeared. Its harmonious
modulations are forgotten, and its delicate pronunciation
is no longer heard, but Greek is still spoken at Athens. The
language, of course, exhibits those features which constitute the
principal difference between ancient and modern languages; prepositions
and particles have supplanted affixes and inflexions,
auxiliary verbs supply the gaps caused by the crumbling away of
the old conjugations, and literal translations of modern modes of
speech give an air of incongruity and barbarism; but still the
language is upon the whole wonderfully preserved. A well-educated
modern Greek would find less difficulty in understanding
the writings of Xenophon than an Englishman would experience
in reading Chaucer, or perhaps Spenser.</p>

<p class='c011'>Greek has evinced not only vitality, but individuality likewise.
Compared with other languages, its stream flowed pure
through barbarous lands, and was but little tinged or polluted
by the soil through which it passed. There is nothing of this
in Latin, neither the vitality nor the power of resistance to
change. Strange to say, although partially derived from the
same source, its properties appear to be totally different. Latin
seems to have a strong disposition to change; it readily became
polished, and as readily barbarized; it had no difficulty in enriching
itself with new expressions borrowed from the Greek, and
conforming itself to Greek rules of taste and grammar. When
it came in contact with the languages of other nations, the affinity
which it had for them was so strong that it speedily amalgamated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>with them, but it did not so much influence them as itself
receive an impress from them. It did not supersede, but it became
absorbed in and was corrupted by, other tongues. Probably,
as it was originally made up of many European elements,
it recognised a relationship with all other languages, and therefore
readily admitted of fusion together with them into a composite
form. Its existence is confined within the limits of less
than eight centuries. It assumed a form adapted for literary
composition less than two centuries and a half before the Christian
era, and it ceased to be a spoken language in the sixth
century.</p>

<p class='c011'>As long as the Roman empire existed in its integrity, and the
capital city retained its influence as the patron to whom all literary
men must look for support, and as the model of refinement
and civilization, the language maintained its dominion. Provincial
writers endeavoured to rid themselves of their provincialisms.
At Rome they formed their taste and received
their education. The rule of language was the usage of the
capital; but when the empire was dismembered, and language
was thus set free from its former restrictions, each section of it
felt itself at liberty to have an independent language and literature
of its own, the classical standard was neglected, Latin
rapidly became barbarized. Again, Latin has interpenetrated
or become the nucleus of every language of civilized Europe;
it has shown great facilities of adaptation, but no individuality
or power to supersede; but the relation which it bears to them
is totally unlike that which ancient Greek bears to modern.
The best Latin scholar would not understand Dante or Tasso,
nor would a knowledge of Italian enable one to read Horace
and Virgil.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old Roman language, as it existed previous to coming in
contact with Greek influences, has almost entirely perished. It
will be shown hereafter that only a few records of it remain;
and the language of these fragments is very different from that
of the classical period. Nor did the old language grow into the
new like the Greek of two successive ages by a process of development,
but it was remoulded by external and foreign influences.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>So different was the old Roman from classical Latin,
that although the investigations of modern scholars have enabled
us to decipher the fragments which remain, and to point out the
analogies which exist between old and new forms, some of them
were with difficulty intelligible to the cleverest and best educated
of the Augustan age. The treaty which Rome made with
Carthage in the first year of the Republic was engraved on
brazen tablets, and preserved in the archives of the Capitol.
Polybius had learning enough to translate it into Greek, but he
tells us that the language of it was too archaic for the Romans
of his day.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>A wide gap separates this old Latin from the Latin of Ennius,
whose style was formed by Greek taste; another not so wide is
interposed between the age of Ennius and that of Plautus and
Terence, both of whom wrote in the language of their adopted
city, but confessedly copied Greek models; and, lastly, Cicero
and the Augustan poets mark another age, to which from the
preceding one, the only transition with which we are acquainted
is the style of oratory of Caius Gracchus, which tradition informs
us was free from ancient rudeness, although it had not acquired
the smoothness and polish of Hortensius or Cicero.</p>

<p class='c011'>In order to arrive at the origin of the Latin language it will
be necessary to trace that of the Romans themselves. In the
most distant ages to which tradition extends, the peninsula of
Italy appears to have been inhabited by three stocks or tribes
of the great Indo-Germanic family. One of these is commonly
known by the name of Oscans; another consisted of two branches,
the Sabellians, or Sabines, and the Umbrians; the third were
called Sikeli, sometimes Vituli and Itali. What affinities there
were between these and the other Indo-European tribes out of
Italy, or by what route they came from the original cradle of the
human race is wrapped in obscurity. Donaldson considers that
all the so-called aboriginal inhabitants of Italy were of the same
race as the Lithuanians or old Prussians. The Oscans evidently,
from the name which tradition assigns to them, claimed to be
the aboriginal inhabitants. The name Osci, or Opici, which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>a longer form of it, is etymologically connected with Ops, the
goddess Earth, and consequently their national appellation is
equivalent to the Greek terms <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αυτοχθονες</span>, or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γηγενεις</span>, the “children
of the soil.” That the Sabellians and Umbrians are
branches of the same stock is proved by the similarity which has
been discovered to exist between the languages spoken by them.
The Umbrians also claimed great antiquity, for the Greeks are
said to have given them their name from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ομβρος</span>, rain; implying
that they were an antediluvian race, and had survived the storms
of rain which deluged the world. Pliny likewise considers
them the most ancient race in Italy.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The original settlements of the Umbrians extended over the
district bounded on one side by the Tiber, on the other by the
Po. All the country to the south was in the possession of the
Oscans, with the exception of Latium, which was inhabited by
the Sikeli. But in process of time, the Oscans, pressed upon
by the Sabellians, invaded the abodes of this peaceful and rural
people, some of whom submitted and amalgamated with their
conquerors, the rest were driven across the narrow sea into
Sicily, and gave the name to that island.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a> These native tribes
were not left in undisturbed possession of their rich inheritance.
There arrived in the north of Italy that enterprising race, famed
alike for their warlike spirit and their skill in the arts of peace,
the Pelasgians (or dark Asiatics,) and became the civilizers of
Italy. Historical research has failed to discover what settlements
this wonderful race inhabited immediately previous to
their occupation of Etruria. According to Livy’s account<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a> they
must have arrived in Italy by sea, for he asserts that their
first settlements were south of the Apennines, that thence they
spread northwards, and that the Rhæti were a portion of them,
and spoke their language in a barbarous and corrupt form. His
testimony ought to have some weight, because, as a native of the
neighbourhood, he probably knew the Rhætian language. Their
immigration must have taken place more than one thousand
years before Christ,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a> and yet they were far advanced in the arts
of civilization and refinement, and the science of politics and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>social life. They enriched their newly-acquired country with
commerce, and filled it with strongly-fortified and populous cities;
their dominion rapidly spread over the whole of Italy from sea to
sea, from the Alps to Vesuvius and Salerno, and even penetrated
into the islands of Elba and Corsica.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a> Herodotus<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c012'><sup>[10]</sup></a> asserts that
they migrated from Lydia; and this tradition was adopted by the
Romans and by themselves.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a> Dionysius<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c012'><sup>[12]</sup></a> rejects this theory on the
grounds that there is no similarity between the Lydian and
Etruscan language, religion, or institutions, and that Xanthus, a
native Lydian historian, makes no mention of this migration.
Doubtless the language is unique, nor can a connexion be traced
between it and any family; but their alphabet is Phœnician, their
theology and polity oriental, their national dress and national
symbol, the eagle, was Lydian, and a remarkable custom alluded
to both by Herodotus<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c012'><sup>[13]</sup></a> and Plautus<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c012'><sup>[14]</sup></a> was Lydian likewise.</p>

<p class='c011'>Entering the territory of the Umbrians, they drove them before
them into the rugged and mountainous districts, and themselves
occupied the rich and fertile plains. The head-quarters
of the invaders was Etruria; the conquered Umbrians lived
amongst them as a subject people, like the Peloponnesians under
their Dorian conquerors, or the Saxons under the Norman nobility.
This portion of the Pelasgians called themselves Rasena,
the Greeks spoke of them as Tyrseni, a name evidently connected
with the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τυρρις</span> or <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τυρσις</span> (Latin, Turris,) and which
remarkably confirms the assertion of Herodotus, since the only
Pelasgians who were famed for architecture or tower-building,
were those who claimed a Lydian extraction, namely, the Argives
and Etruscans.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c012'><sup>[15]</sup></a> This theory of the Pelasgian origin of
the Etruscans is due to Lepsius,<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c012'><sup>[16]</sup></a> and has been adopted by
Donaldson;<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c012'><sup>[17]</sup></a> and if it be correct, the language of Etruria was
probably Pelasgian amalgamated with, and to a certain extent
corrupted by, the native Umbrian.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Pelasgian supremacy on the left bank of the Tiber found no
one to dispute it. Let us now turn our attention to the influence
of these invaders in lower Italy. As they marched southwards,
they vanquished the Oscans and occupied the plains of
Latium. They did not, however, remain long at peace in the
districts which they had conquered. The old inhabitants returned
from the neighbouring highlands to which they had been
driven, and subjugated the northern part of Latium.</p>

<p class='c011'>The history of the occupation of Etruria, which has been already
related, was here acted over again, with only the following
alteration, that here the Oscan was the dominant tribe, and
the subject people amongst whom they took up their abode were
Pelasgians and Sikeli, by whom the rest of the low country of
Latium were still occupied. The towns of the north formed a
federal union, of which Alba was the capital, whilst of the
southern or Pelasgian confederacy the chief city was Lavinium,
or Latinium. The conquering Oscans were a nation of warriors
and hunters, and consequently, as Niebuhr remarked, in the language
of this district the terms belonging to war and hunting
are Oscan, whilst those which relate to peace and the occupations
of rural life are Pelasgian. As, therefore, the language
of Etruria was Pelasgian, corrupted by Umbrian, so Pelasgian
+ Oscan is the formula which presents the language of Latium.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the Roman or Latin language is still more composite in
its nature, and consists of more than these two elements. This
phenomenon is also to be accounted for by the origin of the Roman
people. The septi-montium upon which old Rome was built
was occupied by different Italian tribes. A Latin tribe belonging,
if we may trust the mythical tradition, to the Alban confederacy,
had their settlement upon the Mount Palatine, and a Sabine
or Sabellian community occupied the neighbouring heights of the
Quirinal and Capitoline. Mutual jealousy of race kept them for
some time separate from each other; but at length the privilege
of intermarriage was conceded, and the two communities became
one people.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Tyrrhene Pelasgians, however, separated only by a small
river from this new state, rapidly rising to power and prosperity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>were not likely to view its existence without distrust and jealousy.
Accordingly, the early Roman historical traditions evidently
point to a period during which Rome was subject to
Etruscan rule. When the Etruscan dynasty passed away, its influence
in many respects still remained. The religion and mythology
of Etruria left an indelible stamp on the rites and ceremonies
of the Roman people. The Etruscan deities were the natural
gods of Rome before the influence of Greek poetry introduced
the mythology of Homer and Hesiod into her Pantheon. The
characters and attributes of these deities were totally different
from those of Greece. No licentious orgies disgraced their worship;
they were defiled by none of their vices.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c012'><sup>[18]</sup></a> Saturn, Janus,
Sylvanus, Faunus, and other Etruscan deities, were grave, venerable,
pure, and delighted in the simple occupations of rural life.
It was only general features of resemblance which enabled the
poets in later ages to identify Saturn with Kronos, Sylvanus with
Pan, the prophetic Camenæ of the Janiculum with the muses of
Parnassus.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c012'><sup>[19]</sup></a> The point, however, most important for the present
consideration is that their language was likewise permanently
affected.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ethnical affinities which have been here briefly stated,
and which may be considered as satisfactorily established by
the investigations of Niebuhr, Müller, Lepsius, Donaldson, and
others, are a guide to the affinities of the Latin language, and
point out the elements of which it is composed. These elements,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>then, are Umbrian, Oscan, Etruscan, Sabine, and Pelasgian;
but, as has been stated, the Etruscan language was a compound
of Oscan and Pelasgian, and the Sabine was the link between
the Umbrian and Oscan, therefore the elements of the Latin
are reduced to three, namely, Umbrian, Oscan and Pelasgian.
These may again be classified under two heads, the one which has,
the other which has not, a resemblance to the Greek. All Latin
words which resemble Greek are Pelasgian,<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c012'><sup>[20]</sup></a> all which do not are
Oscan and Umbrian. From the first of these classes must of
course be excepted those words—such, for example, as Triclinium,
&amp;c.,—which are directly derived from the Greek, the origin
of which dates partly from the time when Rome began to
have intercourse with the Greek colonies of Magna Græcia,
partly since Greek exercised an influence on Roman literature.
It is clear from the testimony of Horace that the enriching of
the language by the adoption of such foreign words was defended
and encouraged by the literary men of the Augustan
age:—</p>

</div>

<h4 class='c017'>THE UMBRIAN LANGUAGE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>In the neighbourhood of Ugubio,<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c012'><sup>[21]</sup></a> at the foot of the Apennines
(the ancient Iguvium,) were discovered, in <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1444, seven
tables, commonly called the Eugubine Tables. They were in
good preservation, and contained prayers and rules for religious
ceremonies. Some of them were engraved in the Etruscan or
Umbrian characters, others in Latin letters. Lepsius<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c012'><sup>[22]</sup></a> has determined,
from philological considerations, that the date of them
must be as early as from <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;C.</span> 400,<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c012'><sup>[23]</sup></a> and that the letters were
engraved about two centuries later. A comparison of the two
shows, in the Umbrian character, the letter <i>s</i> standing in the
place occupied by <i>r</i> in the Latin, and <i>k</i> in the place of <i>g</i>, because
the Etruscan alphabet, with which the Umbrian is the
same, did not contain the medial letters <i>B</i>, <i>G</i>, <i>D</i>. An analogous
substitute is seen in the transition from the old to the more modern
Latin. The names Furius and Caius, for example, were
originally written Fusius and Gaius. <i>H</i> is also introduced between
two vowels, as stahito for stato, in the same way that in
Latin aheneus is derived from <i>aes</i>. It also appears that the termination
of the masculine singular was <i>o</i>: thus, orto = ortus;
whilst that of the plural was or; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">e. g.</span></i>, subator = subacti; screhitor
= scripti. This mode of inflexion illustrates the form
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>amaminor for amamini, which was itself a participle used for
amamini estis, an idiom analogous to the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τετυμμενοι εισι</span>.</p>

  <h4 class='c017'>THE OSCAN LANGUAGE.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The remains which have come down to us of this language
belong, in fact, to a composite idiom made up of the Sabine and
Oscan. Although its literature has entirely perished, inscriptions
fortunately still survive; but as they must have been engraved
long subsequently to the settlement of the Sabellians in
Southern Italy, the language in which they are written must necessarily
be compounded of those spoken both by the conquerors
and the conquered. Although Livy<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c012'><sup>[26]</sup></a> makes mention of an
Oscan dramatic literature, for he tells us that the “Fabulæ Atellanæ”
of the Oscans were introduced when a pestilence raged
at Rome,<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c012'><sup>[27]</sup></a> together with other theatrical entertainments, he only
speaks of the Oscan language in one passage.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c012'><sup>[28]</sup></a> This, however,
is an important one, because it proves that Oscan was the vernacular
tongue of the Samnites at that period. He relates that
Volumnius sent spies into the Samnite camp who understood
Oscan: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gnaros Oscæ linguæ exploratum quid agatur mittit.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is clear that the reason why the Oscan language prevailed
amongst this people is, that the dominant orders in Samnium
were Sabines. But there is evidence of the existence of Oscan
in Italy at a still later period. Niebuhr<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c012'><sup>[29]</sup></a> asserts that in the
Social War<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c012'><sup>[30]</sup></a> the Marsi spoke Oscan, although in writing they
used the Latin characters. Some denarii still exist struck by
the confederate Italian Government established in that war at
Corfinium, on which the word <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Italia</span></i> is inscribed, whilst others
bear the word Viteliu. The latter is the old Oscan orthography,
the former the Latin. One class of these coins, therefore, was
struck for the use of the Sabine, the other of the Marsian allies.
It is said also that Oscan was spoken even after the establishment
of the empire.</p>

<p class='c011'>The principal monument of the Sabello-Oscan is a brass plate
which was discovered <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1793. As the word <i>Bansæ</i> occurs
in the 23d line of the inscription, it has been supposed to refer
to the town of Bantia, which was situated not far from the spot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>where the tablet was found, and it is therefore called the Bantine
Table. In consequence of the perfect state of the central
portion, much of this inscription has been interpreted with tolerable
certainty and correctness. The affinity may be traced
between most of the words and their corresponding Latin; and
it is perfectly clear that the variations from the Latin follow
certain definite rules, and that the grammatical inflexions were
the same as in the oldest Latin. A copy of the Table may be
found in the collection of Orellius, and also in Donaldson’s
“<cite class='quote'>Varronianus</cite>.”<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c012'><sup>[31]</sup></a> The following are a few specimens of words
in which a resemblance to the Latin will be readily recognised,
and also, in some instances, the relation of the Oscan to the
other ancient languages of Italy:—</p>

<p class='c011'>To these other well-known words may be added, which all
philologers allow to be originally Oscan, but which have been
incorporated with the Latin—such as, for example, Brutus, Cascus,
Catus, Fœdus, Idus, Porcus, Trabea; and names of deities,
such as Fides, Terminus, Vertumnus, Fors, Flora, Lares, Mamers,

<h4 class='c017'>THE ETRUSCAN LANGUAGE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The difficulty and obscurity in which the Etruscan language
is involved are owing to the nature of the inscriptions and monuments
which have been discovered. Those records, to which
reference has already been made when speaking of the Umbrian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>and Sabello-Oscan, were of a ceremonial or legal character;
they therefore contained connected phrases and sentences,
varied modes of thought and expression. Monuments such as
the Eugubine or Bantine Tables contribute not a little towards
a vocabulary of the languages, and still more to a knowledge of
their structure and analogies. This, however, is not the case
with the Etruscan monuments of antiquity which have been
hitherto discovered. They are, indeed, numerous, but they exhibit
little variety. They are sepulchral records of a complimentary
kind, or titles inscribed on statues and votive offerings.
Hence the same brief phraseology continually recurs, and the
principal portions of the inscriptions are occupied by proper
names.</p>

<p class='c011'>The most important, because the largest, Etruscan record
which has been hitherto discovered, is one which was found
near Perugia, <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1822.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c012'><sup>[32]</sup></a> This inscription contains one hundred
and thirty-one words and abbreviations of words, and of
these no fewer than thirty-eight are proper names. Of the rest,
a vast number are either frequently repeated, or are etymologically
connected. These have not proved sufficient to enable
any philologist (although many have attempted it) to give a satisfactory
and trustworthy explanation of its contents.</p>

<p class='c011'>A comparison of the Perugian with the Eugubine inscription
shows the existence of similarity between some of the words
found in both of them; and this is exactly what we should <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</span></i>
expect to result from the theory of the Etruscan being a
compound of the Pelasgian and Umbrian. In the Perugian inscription,
words which resemble the Umbrian forms are more
numerous than those which seem to have an affinity for the Pelasgian.
Indeed, the language in which it is written appears
almost entirely to have lost the Pelasgian element. The same
observation may be made with respect to the Cortonian inscription:<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c012'><sup>[33]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<p class='c021'>Arses verses Sethlanl tephral ape termnu pisest estu; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i> Avertas
ignem Vulcane victimarum carne post terminum piatus esto; Avertas
ignem Vulcane in cinerem redigens qui apud terminum piatus esto.</p>

</div>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Probably, therefore, both these belong to a period at which the
old Umbrian of the conquered tribes had been exercising a
long-continued influence in corrupting the pure Pelasgian of the
conquerors.</p>

<p class='c011'>One example of the Etruscan alphabet is extant. It was discovered
in a tomb at Bomarzo, by Mr. Dennis,<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c012'><sup>[34]</sup></a> inscribed round
the foot of a cup, and probably had been a present for a child.
The letters ran from left to right, and are as follows:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>It will be seen from this specimen that the Etruscan language
was deficient in the letters <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Β Γ Δ Ξ Ψ Η Ο Ω</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The following is a catalogue of those Etruscan words which
have been handed down to us, together with their Latin interpretation.
The list is but a meager one, but valuable as containing
some which have been admitted into the Latin, and as
exhibiting many affinities to the Pelasgian:—</p>

explaining this inscription, and has clearly shown many close
affinities to the Greek; but there is another which he quotes,
and which is pronounced by Müller<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c012'><sup>[42]</sup></a> to be pure Pelasgian, which
even in its Pelasgian form is almost Greek:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>It would be impossible in this work to attempt the analysis
of all the known Etruscan words, and to point out their affinities
to the Pelasgian, the Greek, or the Latin; but a few examples
may be given, whilst the reader, who wishes to pursue the subject
further, is referred to the investigations of the learned
author of the “<cite class='quote'>Varronianus</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Aifil, age, is evidently from the same root as the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αἰων</span>,
the digamma, which is the characteristic of the Pelasgian, as it
was of the derivative dialect, the Æolic, being inserted between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>the vowels. Aruns, an agriculturist, contains the root of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀρόω</span>,
to plough. Capys, a falcon, that of capio, to catch. Cassis
(originally capsis,) that of caput, the head. Lituus, a curved
staff, that of obliquus. Toga, that of tego, the dress, which was
originally as much the Etruscan costume as it subsequently became
characteristic of the Roman. Lastly, it is well known
that, whereas the Greeks denoted numbers by the letters of the
alphabet, the Romans had a system of numeral signs. This
was a great improvement. The Greek system of notation was
clumsy, because in reality it only pointed out the order in which
each number stands. The Roman notation, on the other hand,
represented arithmetical quantity, and even the addition and
subtraction of quantities; and this elegant contrivance the Romans
owed to the Etruscans. Their numerals were as follows:—</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/illus_p_051a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c022'>This system is identical with the Roman, for Ʌ inverted became
Ⅴ, and
<img src='images/illus_p_051b.jpg' alt='50' class='px' />,
<img src='images/illus_p_051c.jpg' alt='100' class='px' />,
<img src='images/illus_p_051d.jpg' alt='500' class='px' />,
and <img src='images/illus_p_051e.jpg' alt='1000' class='px' />
became respectively Ⅼ, Ⅽ, Ⅾ, and
ⅭⅠↃ, for which Ⅿ was substituted in later times.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the few examples which have been here given, it is
evident that the Pelasgian element of the Etruscan was most
influential in the formation of the Latin language, as the Pelasgian
art and science of that wonderful people contributed to the
advancement and improvement of the Roman character.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>THE OLD LATIN LANGUAGE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The above observations, and the materials out of which the
old Latin was composed, have prepared the way for some illustrations
of its structure and character. The monuments from
which all our information is derived are few in number: the
conflagration of Rome destroyed the majority; the common accidents
of a long series of years completed the mischief. Almost
the only records which remain are laws, ceremonials, epitaphs,
and honorary inscriptions.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>An example of the oldest Latin extant is contained in the
sacred chant of the Fratres Arvales. The inscription which
embodied this Litany was discovered <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 1778,<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c012'><sup>[43]</sup></a> whilst digging
out the foundations of the sacristy of St. Peter’s at Rome. The
monument belongs to the reign of Heliogabalus;<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c012'><sup>[44]</sup></a> but although
the date is so recent, the permanence of religious formulæ renders
it probable that the inscription contains the exact words
sung by this priesthood in the earliest times.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Fratres Arvales were a college of priests, founded, according
to the tradition, by Romulus himself. The symbolical
ensign of their office was a chaplet of ears of corn (spicea corona,)
and their function was to offer prayers in solemn dances
and processions at the opening of spring for plenteous harvests.
Their song was chanted in the temple with closed doors, accompanied
by that peculiar dance which was termed the tripudium,
from its containing three beats. To this rhythm the Saturnian
measure of the hymn corresponds; and for this reason each
verse was thrice repeated. The hymn contains sixteen letters:
<i>s</i> is sometimes put for <i>r</i>, <i>ei</i> for <i>i</i>, and <i>p</i> for <i>f</i> or <i>ph</i>. The following
is a transcription of it, as given by Orellius, to which an
interpretation is subjoined:—</p>

<p class='c011'>The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leges Regiæ</span></i> are generally considered as furnishing the
next examples, in point of antiquity, of the old Latin language;
but there can be little doubt that, although they were assumed
by the metrical traditions to belong to the period of the kings,<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c012'><sup>[47]</sup></a>
they belong to a later historical period than the laws of the
Twelve Tables. Some fragments of laws, attributed to Numa
and Servius Tullius, are preserved by Festus<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c012'><sup>[48]</sup></a> in a restored and
corrected form, and, therefore, it is to be feared that they have
been modernized in accordance with the orthographical rules of
a later age.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of these laws is quoted by Livy<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c012'><sup>[49]</sup></a> as put in force in the
trial of the surviving Horatius for the murder of his sister when
he returned, as the tradition relates, from his victory over the
Curatii. Another is alluded to by Pliny,<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c012'><sup>[50]</sup></a> which forbids the
sacrificing all fish which have not scales; but they are given in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>modern Latin, and can only be restored to their old form by
conjecture.</p>

<p class='c011'>We may, therefore, proceed at once to a consideration of the
Latin of the Twelve Tables, of which fragments have been preserved
by Cicero, Aulus Gellius, Festus, Gaius, Ulpian, and
others. These fragments are to be found collected together in
Haubold’s “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Institutionum Juris Romani privati lineamenta</span></cite>”

<p class='c011'>Owing to the relation which subsists between P, B, and F or
V, as the soft medial and aspirated pronunciation of the same
letters, P and B, as well as F and V, in Latin, are the representatives
or equivalents of the Greek F sound (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φ</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ϝ</span>,) and V
also sometimes stands in the place of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">β</span>. For example (1,) the
Latin <i>fama</i>, <i>fero</i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">fugio</span></i>, <i>vir</i>, &amp;c., correspond to the Greek
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">φημή, φέρω, φεύγω (Ϝ)Ἄρης</span>. (2.) <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nebula</span></i>, <i>caput</i>, <i>albus</i>, <i>ambo</i>, to
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νεφέλη, κεφαλή, ἀλφός, ἄμφω</span>. Similarly, <i>duonus</i> and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">duellum</span></i> become
<i>bonus</i> and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bellum</span></i>; the transition being from <i>du</i> to a sound like
the English <i>w</i>, thence to <i>v</i>, and lastly to <i>b</i>. The old Latin <i>c</i>
was used as the representative of its corresponding medial G,
as well as K; for example, magistratus, legiones, Carthaginienses
were written on the Columna Rostrata, <i>leciones</i>, <i>macistratus</i>,
<i>Cartacinienses</i>. The representative of the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κ</span> was c; thus
caput stands for <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κεφαλή</span>: the sound <i>qu</i> also, as might be expected,
from its answering to the Greek koppa (Q,) and the Hebrew
koph (<span lang='iw' xml:lang='iw' dir='rtl'>ק</span>,) had undoubtedly in the old Latin the same sound as C
or K, and, therefore, quatio becomes, in composition, cutio; and
quojus, quoi, quolonia, become, in classical Latin, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cujus</span></i>, <i>cui</i>, <i>colonia</i>.
This pronunciation has descended to the modern French
language, although it has become lost in the Italian. A passage
from the “<cite class='quote'>Aulularia</cite>”<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c012'><sup>[68]</sup></a> of Plautus illustrates this assertion, and
Quintilian<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c012'><sup>[69]</sup></a> also bears testimony to the existence of the same
pronunciation in the time of Cicero.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>The aspirate H is in Latin the representative of the Greek
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Χ</span>, as, for example, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">hiems</span></i>, <i>hortus</i>, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">humi</span></i> correspond to
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χείμων, χόρτος, χάμαι</span>, whilst the third Greek aspirated mute <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Θ</span> becomes
a tenuis in the mouths of the early Latins, as in <i>Cartaginienses</i>,
and the <i>h</i> sound was afterwards restored when Greek
exercised an influence over the language as well as the literature
of Rome.</p>

<p class='c011'>The absence of the <i>th</i> sound in the old Latin is compensated
for in a variety of ways; sometimes by an <i>f</i>, as fera, fores, for
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θήρ</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θύρα</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The interchanges which take place between the T and D, and
the liquids L, N, R, can be accounted for on the grammatical
principle,<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c012'><sup>[70]</sup></a> which is so constantly exemplified in the literal
changes of the Semitic languages, that letters articulated by the
same organ are frequently put one for the other. Now D, T,
L, N are all palatals, and in the pronunciation of R also some
use is made of the palate. Hence we find a commutation of <i>r</i>
and <i>n</i> in <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δωρον</span>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">donum</span></i>; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">æreus</span></i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">æneus</span></i>; of <i>t</i> and <i>l</i> in <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θώρηξ</span> and
<i>lorica</i>; <i>d</i> and <i>l</i> in olfacio and odere facio, Ulysses and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Οδυσσεύς</span>; <i>r</i>
and <i>d</i> in <i>auris</i> and <i>audio</i>, <i>arfuise</i>, and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">adfuisse</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the remaining liquid, <i>m</i>, little value seems to have been
attached in Latin. In verse it was elided before a vowel; in
verbs it was universally omitted from the first person of the
present tense, although it was originally its characteristic, and
was only retained in <i>sum</i> and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">inquam</span></i>: it was also omitted in
other words, as <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">omne</span></i> for <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">omnem</span></i>;<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c012'><sup>[71]</sup></a> and Cato the Censor was in
the habit of putting <i>dice</i> and <i>facie</i> for <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dicam</span></i>(or <i>dicem</i>) and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">faciam</span></i>
(<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">faciem</span></i>.)</p>

<p class='c011'>As the Roman <i>x</i> was nothing more than a double letter compounded
of <i>g</i> or <i>c</i> and <i>s</i>, as <i>rego</i>, <i>regsi</i>, <i>rexi</i>; <i>dico</i>, <i>dicsi</i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dixi</span></i>,
the only consonant now remaining for consideration is the sibilant
<i>s</i>. The principal position which it occupies in Latin is as
corresponding to the aspirate in Greek words derived from the
same Pelasgic roots. Thus <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὓς, ἓξ, ὓλη</span>, &amp;c., are represented by
<i>sus</i>, <i>sex</i>, <i>silva</i>. This may possibly be accounted for by the fact
that S is in reality a very powerful aspirate. It is only necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>to try the experiment, in order to prove that a strong expiration
produces a hissing sound. Those words which in classical
Greek are written without an aspirate, such as <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">εἰ, ἄναξ</span>, &amp;c.,
which, nevertheless, have an <i>s</i> in Latin, as si, senex, &amp;c., may
possibly have been at one period pronounced with the stronger
breathing. The most remarkable change, however, which has
taken place with respect to this letter, in the transition from the
old to the classical Latin, is the substitution of <i>r</i> for <i>s</i>. Thus
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fusius</span></i>, <i>Papisius</i>, <i>eso</i>, <i>arbos</i>, &amp;c., become <i>Furius</i>, <i>Papirius</i>, <i>ero</i>,
<i>arbor</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the grammatical inflexions, the principal difference between
the old and the new Latin is, that in nouns the old forms
were longer, and assumed their modern form by a process of
contraction, and that the ablative ended in <i>d</i>, as <i>Gnaivod</i>, <i>sententiad</i>;
consequently the adverbial termination was the same
as <i>suprad</i>, <i>bonod</i>, <i>malod</i>. The same termination appears in the
form of <i>tod</i> in the singular number of the imperative mood.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='small'>SATURNIAN METRE—OPINIONS RESPECTING ITS ORIGIN—EARLY EXAMPLES OF THIS METRE—SATURNIAN BALLADS IN LIVY—STRUCTURE OF THE VERSE—INSTANCES OF RHYTHMICAL POETRY.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The origin and progress of the Roman language have now
been briefly traced, by the help of existing monuments, from
the earliest dawn of its existence, when the fusion of its discordant
elements was so incomplete as to be scarcely intelligible,
to the period when even in the unadorned form of public
records it began to assume a classical shape. But such an analysis
will not be complete without some account of the verse in
which the earliest national poetry was composed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The oldest measure used by the Latin poets was the Saturnian.
According to Hermann,<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c012'><sup>[73]</sup></a> there is no doubt that it was
derived from the Etruscans, and that long before the fountains
of Greek literature were opened; the strains of the Italian bards
flowed in this metre, until Ennius introduced the heroic hexameter.
The grammarian Diomedes<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c012'><sup>[74]</sup></a> attributed the invention of
it to Nævius, and seems to imply that the Roman poet derived
the idea from the Greeks, for his theory is, that he formed the
verse by adding a syllable to the Iambic trimeter. Terentianus
Maurus, as well as Atilius, professed to find verses of this kind
in the tragedies of Euripides and the odes of Callimachus, and
Servius and Censorinus attempted to analyze the Saturnian according
to the strict rules of Greek prosody; but they were
obliged to permit every conceivable license, and to make Roman
rudeness an excuse for a violation of those rules which they
themselves had arbitrarily imposed. The opinion of Bentley
was, that it was a Greek metre introduced into Italy by Nævius.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c012'><sup>[75]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>The only argument in favour of the latter theory is the fact that
the Saturnian is found amongst the verses of Archilochus; but
many circumstances, which shall hereafter be pointed out, combine
to make it far more probable that the use of it by the
Greek poet is an accidental coincidence, than that the old Roman
bards copied it from him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whatever be its history, there can be no doubt that, if it did
not originate in Italy, its rhythm in very early times recommended
itself to the Italian ear, and became the recognised vehicle
of their national poetry. A rude resemblance of it is discernible
in the Eugubine tables; it had obtained a more advanced degree
of perfection in the Arvalian chants, and the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">axamenta</span></i><a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c012'><sup>[76]</sup></a> or Salian
hymns. Examples of it are found in fragments of Roman laws,
which Livy<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c012'><sup>[77]</sup></a> refers to the reign of Tullus Hostilius, and Cicero<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c012'><sup>[78]</sup></a>
to that of Tarquinius Priscus. The epitaphs of the Scipios are
in fact Saturnian næniæ. Ennius, whose era was sufficiently
early for him to know that Nævius, instead of being the inventor
of a new verse, or the introducer of a Greek one, followed the
example of his predecessors, finds fault with the antiquated rudeness
of his Saturnians.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Had the Saturnian been introduced from Greece, Ennius would
not have denied to it the inspiration of the Muses, or have doubted
that its birthplace was on the rocky peaks of Parnassus, nor
would his ear, attuned to the varied melody of Greek poetry,
have been unconscious of its simple and natural rhythm, and
have entirely rejected it for the more ponderous and grandiloquent
hexameter. The truth is, the taste which was formed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the study of Greek letters created a prejudice against the old
national verse. As it was not Greek, it was pronounced rough
and unmusical, and was exploded as old-fashioned. The well-known
passage of Horace represents the prevailing feeling,
although he says that the Saturnian remained long after the introduction
of the hexameter, and that, even in his own day, when
Virgil had brought the Latin hexameter to the highest degree
of perfection, a few traces of that old long-lost poetry, which
Cicero<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c012'><sup>[79]</sup></a> wished for back again, might still be discovered:—</p>

<p class='c011'>The oracle which tradition recorded as having been brought

Pictor, Cincius Alimentus, or Acilius. This lay has also been
conjecturally restored by Hermann.</p>

<p class='c011'>In later times Livius Andronicus translated the whole Odyssey
into Saturnians, and Nævius wrote in the same metre a poem
consisting of seven books, the subject of which was the first Punic
war. Detached fragments of both these have been preserved
by Aulus Gellius, Priscian, Festus, and others, which have been
collected together by Hermann.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c012'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The structure of the Saturnian is very simple, and its rhythmical
arrangement is found in the poetry of every age and
country. Macaulay<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c012'><sup>[83]</sup></a> quotes the following Saturnians from the

dancing, in which each alternate step strongly marked the time,<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c012'><sup>[84]</sup></a>
and the rhythmical beat was repeated in a series of three bars,
which gave to the dance the appellation of tripudium.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Saturnian consists of two parts, each containing three
feet, which fall upon the ear with the same effect as Greek trochees.
The whole is preceded by a syllable in thesis technically
called an anacrusis. For example—</p>

<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>The metre in its original form was perfectly independent of the
rules of Greek prosody; its only essential requisite was the beat
or ictus on the alternate syllable or its representative. The
only law to regulate the stress was that of the common popular
pronunciation. In fact, stress occupied the place of quantity.
Two or three syllables, which, according to the rules of prosody
would be long by position, might be slurred over or pronounced
rapidly in the time of one, as in the following line:—</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus it is clear that the principles which regulated it were
those of modern versification, without any of the niceties and
delicacies of Greek quantity.</p>

<p class='c011'>The anacrusis resembles the introductory note to a musical air,
and does not interfere with the essential quality of the verse,
namely, the three beats twice repeated, any more than it does
in English poems, in which octosyllabic lines, having the stress
on the even places, are intermingled with verses of seven syllables,
as in the following passage of Milton’s L’Allegro:—</p>

      <div class='line'>Mirth, admit me of thy crew.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>It is remarkable that in the degenerate periods of Latin
literature, there was a return to the same old rhythmical principles
which gave birth to the Saturnian verse: ictus was again
substituted for quantity, and the Greek rules of prosody were
neglected for a rhythm consisting of alternate beats, which pervades
most modern poetry.</p>

<p class='c011'>The empire had become so extensive, that the taste of the
people, especially of the provincials, was no longer regulated
by that of the capital, and emphasis and accent became, instead
of metrical quantity, the general rule of pronunciation. This
was the origin of rhythmical poetry. Traces of it may be found
as early as the satirical verses of Suetonius on<a id='t64'></a> J. Cæsar.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>It is the metre of the little jeu d’esprit addressed by the emperor

</div>

<p class='c022'>and other monkish hymns, go far to rescue the old Saturnian
from the charge of ruggedness and rusticity ascribed to it by
Horace and others, whose taste was formed by Greek poetry,
and whose fastidious ears could not brook any harmony but that
which had been consecrated to the outpourings of Greek genius.</p>

<p class='c011'>From this species of verse, which probably prevailed among
the natives of Provence (the Roman Provincia) the Troubadours
derived the metre of their ballad poetry, and thence introduced
it into the rest of Europe. But whatever phases the external
form of ancient poetry underwent, the classical writers both
of Greece and Rome eschewed rhyme. Even to a modern ear
the beautiful effect of the ancient metres is entirely destroyed
by it. It was a false taste and a less refined ear which could
accept it as a compensation for the imperfections of prosody.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although rhyme was introduced as an embellishment of verses
framed on the principle of ictus, and not of quantity, at a very
early period of Christian Latin literature, it is not quite certain
when it came to be added as a new difficulty to the metres of
classical antiquity. It is recorded by Gray<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c012'><sup>[86]</sup></a> that when the children
educated in the monastery of St. Gall addressed a Bishop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>of Constance on his first visitation with expostulatory orations,

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='small'>THREE PERIODS OF ROMAN CLASSICAL LITERATURE—ITS ELEMENTS RUDE—ROMAN RELIGION—ETRUSCAN INFLUENCE—EARLY HISTORICAL MONUMENTS—FESCENNINE VERSES—FABULÆ ATELLANÆ—INTRODUCTION OF STAGE PLAYERS—DERIVATION OF SATIRE.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The era during which Roman classical literature commenced,
arrived at perfection, and declined, may be conveniently divided
into three periods. The first of these embraces its rise and
progress, such traces as are discoverable of oral and traditional
compositions, the rude elements of the drama, the introduction
of Greek literature, and the cultivation of the national taste in
accordance with this model, the infancy of eloquence, and the
construction and perfection of comedy.</p>

<p class='c011'>To this period the first five centuries of the republic may be
considered as introductory; the groundwork and foundation were
then being gradually laid on which the superstructure was built
up; for, properly speaking, Rome had no literature until the
conclusion of the first Punic war.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c012'><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Independently therefore of these 500 years, this period consists
of 160 years extending from the time when Livius Andronicus
flourished<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c012'><sup>[88]</sup></a> to the first appearance of Cicero in public life.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c012'><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The second period ends with the death of Augustus.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c012'><sup>[90]</sup></a> It comprehends
the age of which Cicero is the representative, as the
most accomplished orator, philosopher, and prose writer of his
times, as well as that of Augustus, which is commonly called the
golden age of Latin poetry.</p>

<p class='c011'>The third and last period of Roman classical literature terminates
with the death of Hadrian.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c012'><sup>[91]</sup></a> Notwithstanding the numerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>excellencies which will be seen to distinguish the literature of
this period, its decline had evidently commenced. It missed the
patronage of Augustus and his refined court, and was chilled by
the baneful influence of his tyrannical successors. As the age
of Augustus has been distinguished by the epithet “golden,” so
the succeeding period has been, on account of its comparative
inferiority, designated as “the silver age.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Romans, like all other nations, had oral poetical compositions
before they possessed any written literature. Cicero, in
three places,<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c012'><sup>[92]</sup></a> speaks of the banquet being enlivened by the songs
of bards, in which the exploits of heroes were recited and celebrated.
By these lays national pride and family vanity were
gratified, and the anecdotes thus preserved by memory furnished
the sources of early legendary history.</p>

<p class='c011'>But these lays and legends must not be compared to those of
Greece, which had probably taken an epic form long before they
furnished the groundwork of the Iliad and the Odyssey. In
Roman tradition there are no traces of elevated genius or poetical
inspiration. The religious sentiment was the fertile source
of Greek fancy, which gave a supernatural glory to the effusions
of the bard, painted men as heroes, and heroes as deities; and,
whilst it was the natural growth of the Greek intellect, twined
itself round the affections of the whole people.</p>

<p class='c011'>Roman religion was a ceremonial for the priests, not for the
people; and its poetry was merely formulæ in verse, and soared
no higher than the semi-barbarous ejaculations of the Salian
priests or the Arvalian brotherhood. Fabulous legends doubtless
formed the groundwork of history, and therefore probably
constituted the festive entertainments to which Cicero alludes;
but they were rude and simple, and the narratives founded upon
them, which are embodied in the pages of Livy and others, are
as much improved by the embellishments of the historian, as
these in their turn have been expanded by the poetic talent of
Macaulay.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is scarcely possible to conceive that the uncouth literature
which was contemporary with such rude relics as have come down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>to modern times should have displayed a higher degree of imaginative
power. A few simple descriptive lines, one or two
animating and heart-stirring sentiments, and no more, would be
tolerated as an interruption to the grosser pleasures of the table
amongst a rude and boisterous people. The Romans were men
of actions, not of words; their intellect, though vigorous, was
essentially of a practical character: it was such as to form warriors,
statesmen, jurists, orators, but not poets; in the highest
sense of the word, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i> if by poetic talent is meant the creative
faculty of the imagination. The Roman mind possessed the
germs of those faculties which admit of cultivation and improvement,
such as taste and genius, and the appreciation of the
beautiful, and their endowments rendered them capable of attaining
literary excellence; it did not possess the natural gifts
of fancy and imagination, which were part and parcel of the
Greek mind, and which made them in a state of infancy, almost
of barbarism, a poetical people.</p>

<p class='c011'>With the Romans literature was not of spontaneous growth:
it was the result of external influence. It is impossible to fix
the period at which they first became subject to this influence,
but it is clear that in everything mental and spiritual their
neighbours the Etruscans were their teachers. The influence
exercised by this remarkable people was not only religious, but
moral: its primary object was discipline, its secondary one refinement.
If it cultivated the intellectual powers, it was with a
view to disciplining the moral faculties. To this pure culture
the old Roman character owed its vigour, its honesty, its incorruptible
sternness, and those virtues which are summed up in the
comprehensive and truly Roman word “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">gravitas</span>.” History
proves that these qualities had a real existence—that they were
not the mere ideal phantasies of those who loved to praise times
gone by. The error into which those fell who mourned over
the loss of the old Roman discipline, and lamented the degeneracy
of their own times, was, that they attributed this degeneracy
to the onward march of refinement and civilization, and not to
the accidental circumstance that this march was accompanied by
profligacy and effeminacy, and that the race which was the dispensers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>of these blessings was a corrupt and degenerate one.
They could not separate the causes and the effects; they did not
see that Rome was intellectually advanced by Greek literature,
but that unfortunately it was degraded at the same time by
Greek profligacy.</p>

<p class='c011'>For centuries the Roman mind was imbued with Etruscan
literature; and Livy<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c012'><sup>[93]</sup></a> asserts that, just as Greek was in his own
day, it continued to be the instrument of Roman education during
five centuries after the foundation of the city.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tendency of the Roman mind was essentially utilitarian.
Even Cicero, with all his varied accomplishments, will recognise
but one end and object of all study, namely, those sciences which
will render a man useful to his country:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quid esse igitur censes
discendum nobis?... Eas artes quæ efficiunt ut usui civitati
simus; id enim esse præclarissimum sapientiæ munus maximumque
virtutis vel documentum vel officium puto.</span>”<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c012'><sup>[94]</sup></a> We must,
therefore, expect to find the law of literary development modified
in accordance with this ruling principle. From the very beginning,
the final cause of Roman literature will be found to have
been a view to utility, and not the satisfaction of an impulsive
feeling.</p>

<p class='c011'>In other nations poetry has been the first spontaneous production.
With the Romans the first literary effort was history.
But their early history consisted simply of annals and memorials—records
of facts, not of ideas or sentiments. It was calculated
to form a storehouse of valuable materials for future ages, but it
had no impress of genius or thought; its merits were truth and
accuracy; its very facts were often frivolous and unimportant,
neither rendered interesting as narratives, nor illustrated by
reflections. These original documents were elements of literature
rather than deserving the name of literature itself—antiquarian
rather than historical. The earliest records of this kind
were the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Libri Lintei</span></cite>—manuscripts written on rolls of linen
cloth, to which Livy refers as containing the first treaty between
Rome and Carthage, and the truce made with Ardea and Gabii.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c012'><sup>[95]</sup></a>
To these may be added the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Annales Maximi</span></cite>, or <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Commentarii
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Pontificum</span></cite>, of the minute accuracy of which, the following account
is given by Servius.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c012'><sup>[96]</sup></a> “Every year the chief pontiff inscribed
on a white tablet, at the head of which were the names
of the consuls and other magistrates, a daily record of all memorable
events both at home and abroad. These commentaries
or registers were afterwards collected into eighty books, which
were entitled by their authors <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Annales Maximi</span></cite>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Similar notes of the year were kept regularly from the earliest
periods by the civil magistrates, and are spoken of by Latin
authors under the titles of <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Commentarii Consulares</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Libri Prætorum</span></cite>,
and <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tabulæ Censoriæ</span></cite>. All these records, however, which
were anterior to the capture of Rome by the Gauls, perished in
the conflagration of the city.</p>

<p class='c011'>Each patrician house, also, had its private family history, and
the laudatory orations said to have been recited at the funerals
of illustrious members, were carefully preserved, as adorning
and illustrating their nobility; but this heraldic literature obscured
instead of throwing a light upon history: it was filled with
false triumphs, imaginary consulships, and forged genealogies.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c012'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The earliest attempt at poetry, or rather versification, for it
was simply the outward form and not the inward spirit which
the rude inhabitants of Latium attained, was satire in somewhat
of a dramatic form. <cite>The Fescennine songs</cite> were metrical, for
the accompaniments of music and dancing necessarily subjected
their extemporaneous effusions to the restrictions of a rude
measure. Like the first theatrical exhibitions of the Greeks,
they had their origin, not in towns, but amongst the rural population.
They were not, like Greek tragedy, performed in honour
of a deity, nor did they form a portion of a religious ceremonial.
Still, however, they were the accompaniment of it, the pastime
of the village festival. Religion was the excuse for the holiday
sport, and amusement its natural occupation. At first they were
innocent and gay, their mirth overflowed in boisterous but good-humoured
repartee; but liberty at length degenerated into license,
and gave birth to malicious and libellous attacks on persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>of irreproachable character.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c012'><sup>[98]</sup></a> As the licentiousness of Greek
comedy provoked the interference of the legislature, so the laws
of the Twelve Tables forbade the personalities of the Fescennine
verses.</p>

<p class='c011'>This infancy of song illustrates the character of the Romans
in its rudest and coarsest form. They loved strife, both bodily
and mental: with them the highest exercise of the intellect was
in legal conflict and political debate; and, on the same principle,
the pleasure which the spectators in the rural theatre derived
from this species of attack and defence, approached somewhat
nearly to the enthusiasm with which they would have witnessed
an exhibition of gladiatorial skill. The rustic delighted in the
strife of words as he would in the wrestling matches which also
formed a portion of his day’s sports, and thus early displayed
that taste, which, in more polished ages, and in the hands of
cultivated poets, was developed in the sharp cutting wit, the
lively but piercing points of Roman satire.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Fescennine verses show that the Romans possessed a
natural aptitude for satire. The pleasure derived from this
species of writing, as well as the moral influence exercised by it,
depends not upon an æsthetic appreciation of the beautiful, but
on a high sense of moral duty; and such a sense displays itself
in a stern and indignant abhorrence of vice rather than a disposition
to be attracted by the charms and loveliness of virtue.
The Romans were a stern, not an æsthetic people, consequently
satire is the most original of all Roman literature, and the perfect
and polished form which it afterwards assumed was entirely
their own. They did, indeed, afterwards acutely observe and
readily seize upon those parts of Greek literature which were
subservient to this end, and hence Lucilius, the founder of Roman
satire, eagerly adopted the models and materials which Greek
comedy placed at his disposal, and thus became, as Horace<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c012'><sup>[99]</sup></a> writes,
a disciple of Eupolis, Cratinus, and Aristophanes.</p>

<p class='c011'>So permanent was the popularity of these entertainments that
they even survived the introduction of Greek letters, and received
a polish and refinement from the change which then took place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>in the spirit of the national poetry.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c012'><sup>[100]</sup></a> It has been said, that in
these rude elements of the drama, Etruria was the first teacher
of Latium, and that the epithet, Fescennine, perpetuates the name
of an Etrurian village, Fescennia, from which the amusement
derived its origin; but Niebuhr has shown that Fescennia was
not an Etruscan village, and, therefore, that this etymology is
untenable.</p>

<p class='c011'>The most probable etymology of the word Fescennine is one
given by Festus.<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c012'><sup>[101]</sup></a> Fascinium was the Greek Phallus, the emblem
of fertility; and as the origin of Greek comedy was derived
from the rustic Phallic songs, so he considers that the same ceremonial
may be, in some way, connected with the Fescennine
verses. If this be the true account, the Etruscans furnished the
spectacle—all that which addresses itself to the eye, whilst the
habits of Italian rural life supplied the sarcastic humour and
ready extemporaneous gibe, which are the essence of the true
comic; and these combined elements having migrated from the
country to the capital, and being enthusiastically adopted by
young men of more refined taste and more liberal education,
afterwards paved the way for the introduction and adaptation
of Greek comedy.</p>

<p class='c011'>If in these improvisatory dialogues may be discerned the germ
of the Roman Comic Drama, the next advance in point of art
must be attributed to the Oscans. Their quasi-dramatic entertainments
were most popular amongst the Italian nations. They
represented in broad caricature national peculiarities: the language
of the dialogue was, of course, originally Oscan, the characters
of the drama were Oscan likewise.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c012'><sup>[102]</sup></a> The principal one
was called Macchus, whose part was that of the Clown in the
modern pantomime. Another was termed Bucco, who was a kind
of Pantaloon, or charlatan. Much of the wit consisted in practical
jokes like that of the Italian Polichinello. These entertainments
were sometimes called Ludi Osci, but they are more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>commonly known by the title of Fabulæ Atellanæ, from Aderla,<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c012'><sup>[103]</sup></a>
or, as the Romans pronounced it, Atella, a town in Campania, where
they were very popular, or perhaps first performed. After their
introduction at Rome they underwent great modifications and received
important improvements. They lost their native rusticity;
their satire was good natured; their jests were seemly, and kept
in check by the laws of good taste, and were free from scurrility
or obscenity.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c012'><sup>[104]</sup></a> They seem in later times to have been divided,
like comedies, into five acts, with exodia,<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c012'><sup>[105]</sup></a> <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i> farcical interludes
in verse, interspersed between them. Nor were they acted by
the common professional performers. The Atellan actors<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c012'><sup>[106]</sup></a> formed
a peculiar class; they were not considered infamous, nor were they
excluded from the tribes, but enjoyed the privilege of immunity
from military service. Even a private Roman citizen might take
a part in them without disgrace or disfranchisement, although
these were the social penalties imposed upon the regular <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">histrio</span></i>.
The Fabulæ Atellanæ introduced thus early remained in favour
for centuries. The dictator Sylla is said to have amused his
leisure hours in writing them; and Suetonius bears testimony to
their having been a popular amusement under the empire.</p>

<p class='c011'>As early, however, as the close of the fourth century, the
drama took a more artificial form. In the consulship of C. Sulpicius
Peticus and C. Dicinius Stolo,<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c012'><sup>[107]</sup></a> a pestilence devastated
Rome. In order to deprecate the anger of the gods, a solemn
lectisternium was proclaimed; couches of marble were prepared,
with cushions and coverlets of tapestry, on which were placed
the statues of the deities in a reclining posture. Before them
were placed well-spread tables, as though they were able to
partake of the feast. On this occasion a company of stage-players
(<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">histriones</span></i>) were sent for from Etruria, as a means, according to
Livy<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c012'><sup>[108]</sup></a> of propitiating the favour of Heaven; but probably also for
the wiser purpose of diverting the popular mind from the contemplation
of their own suffering. These entertainments were
a novelty to a people whose only recognised public sports, up to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>that time, with the exception of the rural drama already described,
had been trials of bodily strength and skill. The exhibitions of
the Etruscan histriones consisted of graceful national dances,
accompanied with the music of the flute, but without either songs
or dramatic action. They were, therefore, simply <i>ballets</i>, and
not <i>dramas</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus the Etruscans furnished the suggestion: the Romans improved
upon it, and invested it with a dramatic character. They
combined the old Fescennine songs with the newly introduced
dances. The varied metres which the unrestrained nature of
their rude verse permitted to the vocal parts, gave to this mixed
entertainment the name of satura (a hodge-podge or pot-pourri,)
from which in after times the word satire was derived. The
actors in these quasi-dramas were professed histriones, and no
further alteration took place until that introduced by Livius
Andronicus.</p>

</div>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Livius Andronicus</span> (<span class='fss'>FLOURISHED ABOUT B. C.</span> 240.)</h4>

<p class='c018'>The events already related had by this time prepared the Roman
people for the reception of a more regular drama, when, at
the conclusion of the first Punic War, the influence of Greek intellect,
which had already long been felt in Italy, extended to
the capital. But not only did the Romans owe to Greece the
principles of literary taste, and the original models from which
the elements of that taste were derived, but their first and earliest
poet was one of that nation. Livius Andronicus, although
born in Italy, educated in the Latin tongue at Rome, and subsequently
a naturalized Roman, is generally supposed to have been
a native of the Greek colony of Tarentum. He was a man of
cultivated mind, and well versed in the literature of his nation,
especially in dramatic poetry. How he came to be at Rome in
the condition of a slave, it is impossible to say. Attius stated
that he was taken prisoner at Tarentum by Q. Fabius Maximus,
when he recovered that city, in the tenth year of the second
Punic War. But Cicero shows, on the authority of Atticus, that
this date is thirty years later than the period at which he first
exhibited at Rome, and Niebuhr<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c012'><sup>[109]</sup></a> considers that the reason why
he is called a Tarentine captive is, from being confounded with
one M. Livius Macatus, mentioned by Livy.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c012'><sup>[110]</sup></a> He may perhaps
have owed his change of fortune to being made a prisoner of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>war; at any rate, he became one of the household of M. Livius
Salinator, and occupied the confidential position of instructor to
his children. The employment as tutors of Greek slaves, who,
being men of education and refinement, had fallen into this position
by the fortune of war, was customary with the wealthy
Romans. By this means there was rapidly introduced amongst
the rising generation of the higher classes a knowledge of that
language and learning which the Romans so eagerly embraced
and so enthusiastically admired.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fidelity in so important a situation generally gained the
esteem and affection of the patron. The generous Roman became
a protector of the man of genius rather than his master, and
conferred upon him the gift of freedom. Andronicus was emancipated
under such circumstances as these, and according to custom
received the name of his former master, Livius, and his
civil and political rank became that of an ærarius. He wrote
a translation, or perhaps an imitation of the Odyssey, in the old
Saturnian metre, and also a few hymns. Niebuhr supposes that
the reason why he has translated or epitomized the Odyssey in
preference to the Iliad is, that it would have greater attractions
for the Romans, in consequence of the relation which it bore to
the ancient legends of Italy. The sea which washes the coast
of Italy was the scene of many of the most marvellous adventures
of Ulysses. Sicily, in which, owing to the wars with Hiero and
the Carthaginians, the Romans now began to take a lively interest,
was represented in the Odyssey as abounding in the elements
of poetry. Circe’s fairy abode was within sight of land—a
promontory of Latium bore her name, and one of Ulysses’
sons by her was, according to the legend of Hesiod, Latinus, the
patriarch of the Latin name. His principal works, however,
were tragedies. The passion of the Romans for shows and exhibitions,
the love of action, and of stirring business-like occupation,
which characterizes them, would make the drama popular,
and it would harmonize with the public entertainments, in which
they had been accustomed to take pleasure from the earliest
times, when tradition informs us that the founder of their race
instituted the solemn games to the equestrian Neptune, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>invited all the neighbours to the spectacle;<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c012'><sup>[111]</sup></a> and when Ancus
celebrated with unwonted splendour the Great Games, and appointed
separate seats and boxes for the knights and senators.<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c012'><sup>[112]</sup></a>
It was probable that Livius Andronicus, coming forward as the
introducer of a new era in literature, would study the character
as well as the language of his newly-adopted countrymen, and
endeavour to please them as well as teach them. In order to
become eventually a leader of the public taste, he would at first
fall in with it to a certain degree. The process by which he
moulded it after the model which he considered the true one,
would be gentle and gradual, not sudden and abrupt. The paucity
and brevity of the fragments which are extant furnish but
little opportunity for forming an accurate estimate of his ability
as a poet, and his competency to guide and form the taste of a
people. Hermann<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c012'><sup>[113]</sup></a> has collected together the fragments of the
Latin Odyssey which are scattered through the works of Gellius,
Priscian, Festus, Nonius, and others, and has compared them
with the Homeric passages of which they are the translations.
Few of these, however, are longer than a single line; and, therefore,
the only opinion which can be formed respecting them is,
that although the versification is rough and rhythmical rather
than metrical, the language is vigorous and expressive, and conveys,
as far as a translation can, the force and meaning of the
original.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nor do the criticisms of the ancient classical authors furnish
much assistance in coming to a decision. Their tastes were so
completely Greek, and the prejudices of their education so strong,
that they could scarcely confess the existence of excellence in a
poet so old as Andronicus. Cicero says in the Brutus,<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c012'><sup>[114]</sup></a> that his
Latin Odyssey was as old-fashioned and rude as would have been
the sculptures of Dædalus, and that his dramas would not bear a
second perusal. Horace, however, is not quite so sweeping in
his strictures. He confesses that he would not condemn the
poems of Livius<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c012'><sup>[115]</sup></a> to utter oblivion, although he remembers them
in connexion with the floggings of his schoolmaster; but he is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>surprised that any one should consider them polished and beautiful,
and not falling far short of critical exactness.</p>

<p class='c011'>A passage in the history of Livy seems to imply that Andronicus
ventured upon some deviations from the ancient plan of
scenic exhibitions.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c012'><sup>[116]</sup></a> According to him, Livius was the first who
substituted, for the rude extemporaneous effusions of the Fescennine
verse, plays with a regular plot and fable. He adds,
that in consequence of losing his voice from being frequently encored,
he obtained permission to introduce a boy to sing the ode,
or air, to the accompaniment of the flute, whilst he himself represented
the action of the song by his gestures and dancing.
He was thus enabled to depict the subject with greater vigour
and freedom of pantomimic action, because he was unimpeded
by the obligation to use his voice. Hence the custom began of
the actor responding by his gesticulation to the song and music
of another, whilst the dialogue between the odes was delivered
without any musical accompaniment.</p>

<p class='c011'>The passage of which the above is a paraphrase, is as follows:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Livius
post aliquot annos qui ab saturis ausus est primus argumento
fabulam serere (idem scilicet, id quod omnes tum erant,
suorum carminum actor) dicitur, quum sæpius revocatus vocem
obtudisset, veniâ petitâ, puerum ad canendum ante tibicinem
quum statuisset, canticum egisse aliquanto magis vigente motu,
quia nihil vocis usus impediebat. Inde ad manum cantari histrionibus
cæptum, diverbiaque tantum ipsorum voci relicta</span>.” It is
evident that this description points out the introduction of the
principles of Greek art. We are reminded of the hyporchemes
in honour of Apollo, in which the gestures of certain members
of the chorus represented the incidents related or sentiments
expressed by the singer, and also the separation of the choral
or musical part from the dialogue of a Greek tragedy. Nevertheless,
the choral or lyrical portion of the drama to which alone
this novel practice introduced by Livius applies, found but a small
part in a Latin tragedy, if compared with those of the Greeks.
In this alone the poet himself sustained a part, whilst the whole
of the dialogue (diverbia) was recited by professional performers.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>This new style of dramatic performances, however, does not
appear at first to have taken such hold upon the affections of the
people as to supersede their old amusements. They admitted
them, and witnessed them with pleasure and applause, but they
would not give up the old. The young men wished their amusements
to be really games and sports; they were not content to
be merely quiet spectators. Extemporaneous effusions were
more convenient for amateurs than regular plays, and joke and
jest than tragic earnest. The new custom introduced by Livius
elevated the drama above the region of ribaldry and laughter,
but the art and skill requisite confined the work to the professional
performer. The young Romans, therefore, left to the
stage-player the regular drama, restored their old amusement as
an exodium or after-piece, and did not suffer it, as Livy says, to
be “polluted” by the interference of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">histriones</span></i>. According to
the testimony of Cicero,<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c012'><sup>[117]</sup></a> who makes his statement on the authority
of Atticus, Livius first exhibited his dramas in the year before
the birth of Ennius, in the consulship of C. Clodius and M.
Tuditanus, <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;C.</span> 514.<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c012'><sup>[118]</sup></a> This date is also adopted by Aulus
Gellius,<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c012'><sup>[119]</sup></a> who places his first dramatic representations about a
hundred and sixty years after the death of Sophocles, and fifty-two
years after that of Menander. The titles of his tragedies
which are extant show that they were translations or adaptations
from the Greek. Amongst them are those of Egisthus, Hermione,
Tereus, Ajax, and Helena. From each of the last two
one line is preserved, and four lines are quoted by Terentianus
Maurus from his tragedy of Ino;<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c012'><sup>[120]</sup></a> but the language and metre
render it far more probable that they were written by some
more modern poet. Two of his tragedies, the Clytemnestra and
the Trojan Horse, were acted in the second consulship of Pompey
the Great, at the inauguration of the splendid stone theatre<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c012'><sup>[121]</sup></a>
which he built. No expense was spared in putting them upon
the stage, for Cicero writes, in a letter to M. Marius,<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c012'><sup>[122]</sup></a> that three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>thousand bucklers, the spoils of foreign nations, were exhibited in
the latter, and a procession of six hundred mules, probably richly
caparisoned, were introduced in the former, whilst cavalry and
infantry, clad in various armour, mingled in mimic combat on
the scene. He considers, however, that this splendour was an
offence against good taste, and that the enjoyment was spoilt by
the gorgeousness of the spectacle. The taste of his patrons, the
Roman people, as well as the testimony of antiquity, render it
highly probable that he was the author of comedies<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c012'><sup>[123]</sup></a> as well as
tragedies. Festus speaks of one, of which he quotes a single
line, for the sake of its philological value.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>CN. NÆVIUS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Nævius was the first poet who really deserves the name of
Roman. His countrymen in all ages, as well as his contemporaries,
looked upon him as one of themselves. The probability
is, that he was not actually born at Rome, though even this has
been maintained with some show of plausibility.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c012'><sup>[124]</sup></a> He was, at
any rate, by birth entitled to the municipal franchise, and from
his earliest boyhood was a resident in the capital. Nor was he
a mere servile imitator, but applied Greek taste and cultivation
to the development of Roman sentiments. A true Roman in
heart and spirit in his fearless attachment to liberty; his stern
opposition to all who dared invade the rights of his fellow-citizens;
he was unsparing in his censure of immorality, and his admiration
for heroic self-devotion. He was a soldier, and imbibed
the free and martial enthusiasm which breathes in his poems
when he fought the battles of his country in the first Punic War.
His honest principles cemented, in his later years, a strong friendship
between him and the upright and unbending Cato,<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c012'><sup>[125]</sup></a>—a
friendship which probably contributed to form the political and
literary character of that stern old Roman.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>It is generally assumed that Nævius was a Campanian; but
the only reason for this assumption is, that A. Gellius<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c012'><sup>[126]</sup></a> criticises
his epitaph, of which Nævius himself was the author, as full of
Campanian pride.</p>

<p class='c011'>The time of his birth is unknown, but it is probable that his
public career commenced within a very few years after that of
Livius. Gellius fixes the exhibition of his first drama in <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span>
235,<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c012'><sup>[127]</sup></a> and Cicero places his death in the consulship of M. Cornelius
Cethegus and P. Sempronius Tuditanus,<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c012'><sup>[128]</sup></a> although he allows
that Varro, who places it somewhat later, is the most pains-taking
of Roman antiquarians. It is also certain that he died
at an advanced age, for, according to Cicero, he was an old man
when he wrote one of his poems. He was the author of an epic
poem, the title of which was the Punic War; but, owing to the
popularity of dramatic literature, his earliest literary productions
were tragedies and comedies. The titles of most of these show
that their subjects were Greek legends or stories. It was,
therefore, in his epic poem that the acknowledged originality of
his talents was mainly displayed. Nævius was a strong political
partisan, a warm supporter of the people against the encroachments
of the nobility. In consequence of the expenditure during
the war, great part of the population was reduced to poverty,
and a strong line of demarkation was drawn between the rich
and the poor. The estrangement and want of sympathy between
those two classes were daily increasing. The barrier of <i>caste</i>
was indeed almost destroyed, but that of <i>class</i> was beginning to
be erected in its stead. The passing of the Licinian bills<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c012'><sup>[129]</sup></a> had led
to the gradual rise of a plebeian nobility. The Ogulnian law<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c012'><sup>[130]</sup></a>
had admitted patrician and plebeian to a religious as well as
political equality, and more than three-quarters of a century
had passed away since Appius Claudius the blind<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c012'><sup>[131]</sup></a> had given
political existence to the freedmen by admitting them into the
tribes, and had even raised some whose fathers had been freedmen
to the rank of senators, to the exclusion of many distinguished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>plebeians who had filled curule offices. The object
which he proposed to himself by this policy was undoubtedly the
depression of the rising plebeian nobility, and this object was
for a time attained; but the ultimate result was a vast increase
in the numbers and the power of those who were opposed to the
old patrician nobility, by the formation of a higher class, the
only qualification for admission into which was wealth and intelligence.
According to the old distinctions of rank it was necessary
that even a plebeian should have a pedigree; his father and
grandfather must have been born free. Appius, when chosen
for the first time, waived this, and introduced a new principle
of political party. Of this anti-aristocratic party Nævius was the
literary representative, and the vehement opponent of privileges
derived from the accident of birth. His position, too, was calculated
to provoke a man of better temper. He was a Roman
citizen, but, as a native of a municipal town, he did not possess
the full franchise which he saw enjoyed by others around him
who were intellectually inferior to himself, and the sense of his
political inferiority was galling to him. Accordingly he used
literature as a new and powerful instrument to foster the jealousy
which existed between the orders of the state. He attacked the
principle of an aristocracy of birth in the persons of some members
of the most distinguished families. He held up Scipio Africanus
to ridicule by making him the hero of a tale of scandal.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The best and most admired writers have paid their homage
to his excellence. Ennius and Virgil discovered in him such a
freshness and power that they unscrupulously copied and imitated
him, and transferred his thoughts into their own poems as
they did those of Homer. Horace writes that in his day the
poems of Nævius were universally read, and were in the hands
and hearts of everybody, and Cicero<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c012'><sup>[137]</sup></a> praises him, although he
had no taste for the old national literature.</p>

<p class='c011'>We cannot be surprised at the universal popularity of Nævius.
His stern love of liberty, his unsparing opposition to aristocratic
exclusiveness, was identical with the old Roman republicanism.
His taste for satire exactly fell in with the spirit of the earliest
Roman literature, whilst he depicted with life and vigour and
graphic skill the scenes of heroism in which the soldier-poet of
the first Punic War was himself an actor. His tragedies were
probably entirely taken from the Greek, but his comedies had undoubted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>pretensions to originality. The titles of many of them
plainly show a Greek origin; but probably all more or less presented
pictures of Roman life and manners, and therefore went
home to the hearts of the people. This is essential to the complete
effectiveness of comedy. Tragedy appeals to higher feelings:
it depicts passions and principles of action which are recognised
by the whole human race; it may, therefore, enlist the
sympathies on the side of those whose habits and manners differ
from our own, as it does in favour of those characters which are
of a heroic and superhuman mould. Comedy professes to describe
real life, and to paint men as they are; it therefore loses
part of its power unless it deals with scenes which the experience
of the audience can realize. Thus it is with painting. The high
art of the Italian school, which selected for its subjects the holy
scenes of religion, the heroism of history, and the creatures of
classical poetry, was fostered by the taste of the rich and noble
amongst a highly cultivated and imaginative people. The homely
realities of the Flemish painters, with their accurate and lifelike
delineations, were the delight of a rude prosaic nation, who could
not appreciate a more elevated style or understand ideal beauties
unless brought down to the level of every-day life.</p>

<p class='c011'>The new form with which Nævius invested comedy gave him
scope for holding up to public scorn the prevailing vices and
follies of the day. He had also another vehicle for personality
in his Ludi or Satiræ, as they were termed by Cicero. These
were comic scenes, and not regular dramas, somewhat resembling
the Atellan farces, without their extemporaneous character. But
his great work was his poem on the first Punic War. We cannot
judge of its merits by the few fragments which remain; but the
testimony borne to it by Cicero, and the use which was made of
it by Ennius and Virgil, prove that it fully deserved the title of
an epic poem. The idea was original, the plot and characters
Roman. The author, although Greek literature taught him how
to be a poet, drew his inspiration from the scenes of his native
Italy and the exploits of his countrymen. To this poem Virgil
owed that beautiful allegorical representation of the undying
enmity between Rome and Carthage, and the disastrous love of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Æneas and Dido. Here was first painted in such touching colours
the self-devoted patriotism of Regulus, whom (although love
of historic truth refuses to believe the legend) the poet represents
as sacrificing home and wife and children to a sense of
honour, and as submitting to a torturing death for the sake of
his country. Probably many other heart-stirring legends and
tales of prowess which had cheered the nightly bivouac of the
soldiers and inspirited them in the field, were embodied in this
popular epic. Not that he disdained any more than Virgil the
aid of Homer.<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c012'><sup>[138]</sup></a> The second book of the Iliad suggested to him
the enumeration of the opposing forces at the commencement of
the struggle, and the description of the storm, from which Virgil,
in his turn, copied in the Æneid,<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c012'><sup>[139]</sup></a> owes much of its energy to
the eighth book of the Odyssey. The expostulation of Venus
with the father of gods and men,<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c012'><sup>[140]</sup></a> respecting the perils of her
son, and the promise of future prosperity to the descendants of
Æneas, with which Jupiter consoles her, as well as the address
of Æneas to his companions, are imitations of passages from this
poem of Nævius; and Ennius copied so much from him and his
predecessors as to have provoked the following rebuke from
Cicero:<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c012'><sup>[141]</sup></a>—“They have written well, if not with all thy elegance,
and so oughtest thou to think who have borrowed so much from
Nævius, if you confess that you have done so, or, if you deny it,
have stolen so much from him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The fragments of Nævius extant are not more numerous than
those of Livius, but some are rather longer. The two following

delight the inartificial although unpolished poetry of Nævius.
Without that elaborate workmanship which was to the Roman
the only substitute for the spontaneous grace and beauty of all
that proceeded from the Greek mind, and was expressed in the
Greek tongue, there is no doubt that Nævius displayed genius,
originality, and dignity. The prejudices of Horace in favour
of Greek taste were too strong for him to value what was old
in poetry, or to sympathize with the admiration of that which
the goddess of death had consecrated.<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c012'><sup>[144]</sup></a> But Cicero, whilst he
attributed to Livius only the mechanic skill and barbaric art of
Dædalus, gave to Nævius the creative talent and plastic power
of Myron.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even when Roman critics were not unanimous in assigning
him a niche amongst the greatest bards, the Roman people loved
him as their national poet, and were grateful to him for his nationality.
They paid him the highest compliment possible by
retaining him as the educator of their youth. Orbilius flogged
his sentiments into his pupil’s memories; and, whilst the niceties
of grammar were taught through the instrumentality of Greek
by Greek instructors, and poetic taste was formed by a study of
the Homeric poems, Nævius still had the formation of the character
of the young Roman gentlemen, and his epic was in the
hands and hearts of every one.</p>

<p class='c011'>One more subject remains to be treated of with reference to
the literary productions of Nævius, and that is, the metrical character
of his poetry. He appreciated that important element of
Greek poetic beauty. The varied versification by means of which
it appeals at once to the ear, just as physical beauty charms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>long before we are attracted by the hidden power of moral excellence,
and external form creates a prejudice in favour of that
which is of more intrinsic value, but cannot so readily be perceived,
so the melody of verse more readily pleases than the
beauty of the imagery and sentiments which the verses convey.
Nævius, therefore, did not disdain to recommend his original
genius by a study of the principles of Greek versification, and
by clothing his thoughts in those which his ear suggested as
being most appropriate to the occasion. He does not seem to
have overcome the difficulties of the heroic metre, although he
studied the Homeric poems.</p>

<p class='c011'>Probably as the Saturnian, the only natural Italian measure
which he found existing, was a triple time, the Roman ear
could not at once adapt itself to the common time of the dactylic
measures. The versification of our own country furnishes an
analogous example. The usual metres of English poetry consist
of an alternation of long and short syllables; dactyles and anapæsts
are of less frequent occurrence and are of more modern
introduction, and the English ear is even yet not quite accustomed
to the hexametrical rhythm. The dignity of the epic is expressed
in the grave march of the iambus; the ballad tells its story in
the same metre, though in shorter lines; the joyous Anacreontic
adopts the dancing step of the trochee. For this reason, perhaps,
Nævius, as a matter of taste, limited himself to the introduction
of iambic and trochaic metres, and the irregular features
of Greek lyric poetry to the exclusion of the heroic hexameter.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was long before the Romans could arrive at perfection in
this metre. Ennius was unsuccessful. His hexameters are rough
and unmusical; he seems never to have perfectly understood the
nature and beauty of the <i>cæsura</i> or pause. The failure of Cicero,
notwithstanding his natural musical ear, is proverbial. No one
previous to Virgil seems to have overcome the difficulty. Versification
seems always to have been somewhat of a labour to the
Romans. In the structure of their poetry they worked by rule;
their finish was artistic, but it was artificial. Hence the Latin
poet allowed himself less metrical liberty than the Greek, whom
he made his model. He seemed to feel that the Greek metres,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>which the education of his taste had compelled him to adopt,
were not precisely the form into which Latin words naturally
fell; that this deficiency must be supplied by the care with which
he moulded his verse, according to the strictest possible standard.
One can imagine the extemporaneous effusions of a Homeric bard;
but to Roman taste which, in every literary work, especially in
poetry, looked for elaborate finish, the power of the improvisator,
who could pour forth a hundred verses standing on one foot, was
a ridiculous pretension.<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c012'><sup>[145]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>As a general rule, no Roman poet attained facility in versification;
Ovid was perhaps the only exception. In the early period,
when Roman poetry was extemporaneous, their national
verse was only rhythmical, and now that modern Italy can boast
of the faculty of improvisation, verse has become rhythmical
again. But although Nævius introduced a variety of Greek
metres to the Romans, the principal part of his poems, and especially
his national epic, were written in the old Saturnian measure:
its structure was indeed less rude, and its metre more regular
and scientific, but still he did not permit the new rules of Greek
poetry to banish entirely the favourite verses “in which in olden
times Fauns and bards sung,” and which would most acceptably
convey to the national ear the achievements of Roman arms.</p>

</div>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Ennius</span> (<span class='fss'>BORN B. C.</span> 239.)</h4>

<p class='c018'>Nævius appears to have occupied a position between two successive
ages; he was the last of the oldest school of writers,
and prepared the way for a new one. Although a true Roman
in sentiment, he admired Greek cultivation. He saw with regret
the old literature of his country fading away, although he
had himself introduced new principles of taste to his countrymen.
He was not prepared for the shock of seeing the old
school superseded by the new. But still the period for this had
arrived, and in his epitaph, as we have seen, he deplored that
Latin had died with him. A love for old Roman literature remained
amongst the goatherds of the hills and the husbandmen
of the valleys and plains, in whose memories lived the old songs
which had been the delight of their infancy: it survived amongst
the few who could discern merit in undisciplined genius; but the
rising generation, who owed their taste to education, admired
only those productions by which their taste had been formed.
Greek literature had now an open field in which to flourish: it
had driven out its predecessor, although as yet it had not struck
its roots deeply into the Roman mind; a new school of poetry
arose, and of that school Ennius was the founder. The principal
events in the life of Ennius are as follows:—he was born at the
little village of Rudiæ, in the wild and mountainous Calabria,
<span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 239.<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c012'><sup>[146]</sup></a> Of ancient and honourable descent,<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c012'><sup>[147]</sup></a> he is said<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c012'><sup>[148]</sup></a> to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>have begun life in a military career, and to have risen to the
rank of a centurion or captain. The anonymous author of the
life of Cato, which is generally attributed to Cornelius Nepos,
relates that Cato in his voyage from Africa to Rome<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c012'><sup>[149]</sup></a> visited
Sardinia, and finding Ennius in that island took him home with
him. But no reason can be assigned why Ennius should have
been there, or why Cato should have gone so far out of his way.
If the Censor did really introduce the poet to public notice at
Rome, he may have made his acquaintance during his quæstorship
in Africa, if Ennius was with Scipio in that province; or during
his prætorship<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c012'><sup>[150]</sup></a> in Sardinia, if the poet was a resident in that
island. There exist, however, no sufficient data to clear up these
difficulties.</p>

<p class='c011'>It seems, moreover, strange that Cato should have been his
patron, and yet that he should have reproached M. Fulvius
Nobilior for taking the poet with him as his companion throughout
his Ætolian expedition.<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c012'><sup>[151]</sup></a> With the exception of this campaign,
Ennius resided during the remainder of his long life at
Rome. Greek and Greek literature were now eagerly sought
after by the higher classes, and Ennius earned a subsistence
sufficient for his moderate wants by tuition. He enjoyed the
friendship and esteem of the leading literary societies at Rome;
and at his death, at the age of seventy, he was buried in the
family tomb of the Scipios, at the request of the great conqueror
of Hannibal, whose fame he contributed to hand down to posterity.
His statue was honoured with a niche amongst the images
of that illustrious race. The following epitaph was written by
himself:—<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c012'><sup>[152]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The epitaph which he wrote in honour of Scipio Africanus has

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>It is probable that death alone put a period to his career as
a poet, and that his last work was completed but a short time
before his decease. So popular was he for centuries, and with
such care were his poems preserved, that his whole works are
said to have existed as late as the thirteenth century.<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c012'><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Literature, as represented by Ennius, attained a higher social
and political position than it had hitherto enjoyed. Livius Andronicus
was, as we have seen, a freedman, and probably a prisoner
of war. Nævius never arrived at the full civic franchise,
nor became anything more than the native of a municipality,
resident at Rome. Hitherto the Romans, although they had
begun to admire learning, had not learned to respect its professors.
Ennius was evidently a gentleman; he was the first to
obtain for literature its due influence. Thus he achieved for
himself the much-coveted privileges of a Roman citizen, to which
Livius had never aspired, and which Nævius was never able to
attain. Hence Cicero always speaks of him with affection as a
fellow-countryman. “Our own Ennius” is the appellation which
he uses when he quotes his poetry. Horace also calls him
“Father Ennius,” a term implying not only that he was the
founder of Latin poetry, but also reverence and regard.</p>

<p class='c011'>To discriminating taste and extensive learning he added that
versatility of talent which is displayed in the great variety of
his compositions. He was acquainted with all the best existing
sources of poetic lore, the ancient legends of the Roman people,
and the best works of the Greek writers; he had critical judgment
to select beautiful and interesting portions, ingenuity to
imitate them, and at the same time genius and fancy to clothe
them with originality. It was not to be expected that he could
be entirely freed from the antiquated style of the old school.
The process of remodelling a national literature, including the
very language in which it is expressed, and the metrical harmonies
in which it falls upon the ear, is almost like reforming the
modes of thought, and reconstructing the character of a people.
Such a work must be gradual and gentle: a nation’s mind will
not bend at once to new principles of taste and new rules of art.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>To attempt a violent revolution would be  absurd, and argue
ignorance of human nature. The poet who attempted it would
fail in gaining sympathy, which is an essential element of success.
To cause such a revolution at all requires a strong will and a
vigorous manly mind; and these are precisely the characteristic
features of the Ennian poetry.</p>

<p class='c011'>If we were to paint the character best adapted to act the part
of a literary reformer to a nation such as the Romans were, it
would be exactly that of Ennius. He was, like his friends Cato
the Censor and Scipio Africanus the elder, a man of action as
well as philosophical thought. He was not only a poet, but he
was a brave and stout-hearted soldier. He had all the singleness
of heart and unostentatious simplicity of manners which marked
the old times of Roman virtue; he lived the life of the Cincinnati,
the Curii, and Fabricii, which the poets of the luxurious
Augustan age professed to admire, but did not imitate. Rome
was now beginning to be wealthy, and wealth to be the badge
of rank; yet the noble poet was respected by the rich and great,
even in his lowly cottage on the Aventine, and found it no discredit
to be employed as an instructor of youth, although it had
been up to his time only the occupation of servants and freedmen.
He was the founder of a new school, and was leading his admirers
forward to a new career; but his imagination could revel in the
recollections and traditions of the past. To him the glorious
exploits of the patriarchs of his race furnished as rich a mine of
fable as the heroic strains of Homer, the marvellous mythologies
of Hesiod, and the tragic heroes of Argos, Mycenæ and Thebes.
His early training in Greek philosophy and poetry, and in the
midst of Greek habits in his native village, had not polished and
refined away his natural freshness. He was a child of art, but
a child of nature still. He had a firm belief in his mission as a
poet, an abiding conviction of his inspiration. He thought he
was not metaphorically, but really, what Horace calls him, a
second Homer,<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c012'><sup>[155]</sup></a> for that the soul of the great Greek bard now
animated his mortal body. He had all the enthusiasm and boldness
necessary for accomplishing a great task, together with a
consciousness that his task was a great and honourable one.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Owing to this rare union of the best points of Roman character
with Greek refinement and civilization, he rendered himself as
well as his works acceptable to the most distinguished men of
his day, and his intimacy and friendship influenced the minds of
Porcius Cato, Lælius, Fulvius Nobilior, and the great Scipio.</p>

<p class='c011'>A comparison of the extant specimens of the old Latin with
the numerous fragments<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c012'><sup>[156]</sup></a> of the poems of Ennius which have been
preserved, will show how deeply they were indebted to him for
the improvement of their language, not only in the harmony of
its numbers and the convenience of its grammatical forms, but
also in its copiousness and power.</p>

<p class='c011'>It must not, however, be supposed that Ennius is to be praised,
not only because he did so much, but because he refrained from
doing more, as though he designedly left an antiquated rudeness,
redolent of the old Roman spirit and simplicity. A language in
the condition or phase of improvement to which he brought it is
valuable in an antiquarian point of view; but it is not to be admired
as if it were then in a higher state of perfection than it
afterwards attained. Elaborate polish may, perhaps, overcome
life and freshness, but no one who possesses any correctness of
ear or appreciation of beauty can prefer the limping hexameters
of Ennius to the musical lines of Virgil, or his later style to the
refined eloquence of the Augustan age. As Quintilian says, we
value Ennius, not for the beauty of his style, but for his picturesqueness,
and for the holiness, as it were, which consecrates
antiquity, just as we feel a reverential awe when we contemplate
the huge gnarled fathers of the forest. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ennium sicut sacros
vetustate lucos adoremus in quibus grandia et antiqua robora,
jam non tantam habent speciem, quantam religionem.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011'>His predecessors had done little to remould the rude and undigested
mass which, as has been shown, was made up of several
elements, thrown together by the chance of war and conquest,
and left to be amalgamated together by the natural genius of
the people. Ennius naturally possessed great power over words,
and wielded that power skilfully. In reconstructing the edifice
he did the most important and most difficult part, although the
result of his labours does not strike the eye as perfect and consummate.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>He laid the foundation strongly and safely. What
he did was improved upon, but was never undone. The taste
of succeeding ages erected on his basement an elegant and beautiful
superstructure. To Ennius we owe the fact that after his
time Latin literature was always advancing until it reached its
perfection. It never went back, because the groundwork on
which it was built was sound.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ennius imitated most of the Greek metrical forms; but he
wrote verses like a learner, and not like one imbued with the
spirit of the metres which he imitated. He attended to the prosodiac
rules of quantity, so far as his observation deduced them
from the analogies of the two languages, instead of the old Roman
principle of ictus or stress; but, provided the number of feet were
correct, and the long and short syllables followed each other in
proper order, his ear was satisfied: it was not as yet sufficiently
in tune to appreciate those minuter accessaries  which embellish
later Latin versification. This is the principal cause of that ruggedness
with which even the admirers of Ennius justly find fault.
But notwithstanding these defects, there are amongst his verses
some as musical and harmonious as those of the best poets in the
Augustan age.</p>

<p class='c011'>His great epic poem, entitled “<cite class='quote'>The Annals</cite>,” gained him the
attachment as well as the admiration of his countrymen. This
poem, written in hexameters, a metre now first introduced to the
notice of the Romans, detailed in eighteen books the rise and
progress of their national glory, from the earliest legendary
periods down to his own times. The only portion of history
which he omitted was the first Punic war; and the reason which
he gives for the omission is that others have anticipated him<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c012'><sup>[157]</sup></a>—alluding
to his predecessors Livius and Nævius.</p>

<p class='c011'>The subject which he proposed to himself was one of considerable
difficulty. The title and scope of his work compelled him
to adopt a strict chronological order instead of the principles of
epic arrangement, and to invest the truths which the course of
history forced upon his acceptance with the interest of fiction.
His subject could have no unity, no hero upon whose fortunes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>the principal interest should be concentrated, and around whom
the leading events should group themselves. But still no history
could be better adapted to his purpose than that of his own
country. Its early legends form a long series of poetical romances,
fit to be sung in heroic numbers, although from being
originally unconnected with each other, incapable of being woven
into one epic story. Ennius had to unite in himself the characters
of the historian and the poet—to teach what he believed to
be truth, and yet to move the feelings and delight the fancy by
the embellishments of fiction. The poetical merit in which he
must necessarily have been deficient was the conduct of the plot;
but the fragments of his poem are not sufficiently numerous for us
to discover this deficiency. They are, however, amply sufficient
to show that he possessed picturesque power both in sketching
his narratives and in portraying his characters. His scenes are
full of activity and animation; his characters seem to live and
breathe; his sentiments are noble, and full of a healthful enthusiasm.
His language is what that of an old Roman ought to be,
such as we might have expected from Cato and Scipio had they
been poets: dignified, chaste, severe, it rises as high as the most
majestic eloquence, although it does not soar to the sublimity of
poetry.</p>

<p class='c011'>The parts in which he approaches most nearly to his great
model, or, as he believed, the source of his inspiration, were in
his descriptions of battles. Here the martial spirit of the Roman
warrior shines forth; the old soldier seems to revel in the scenes
of his youth. The poem which occupied his declining years
shows that it was his greatest pleasure to record the triumphs
of his countrymen, and to teach posterity how their ancestors
had won so many glorious fields. His similes are simply imitations;
they show that he had taste to appreciate the peculiar
features of the Homeric Poem; but as must be the case with
mere imitations, they have not the energy which characterizes
his battles.</p>

<p class='c011'>As a dramatic poet, Ennius does not deserve a high reputation.
A tragic drama must be of native growth, it will not bear transplanting.
The Romans did not possess the elements of tragedy;
the genius of Ennius was not able to remedy that defect, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>could do no more than select, with the taste and judgment which
he possessed, such Greek dramas as were likely to be interesting.
Probably, however, his tragedies never became popular; they
were admired by the narrow literary circle in which his private
life was passed. Those who were familiar with the Greek originals
were delighted to see their favourites transferred into
their native language; those who were not, had their curiosity
gratified, and welcomed even these reflections of the glorious
minds of Æschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the tribute of admiration which the ancient classical
authors paid to Ennius, was paid to him as an epic not as a dramatic
poet. Cicero when he speaks in his praise generally quotes
from the Annals, only once from a tragedy.<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c012'><sup>[158]</sup></a> Virgil borrows
lines and thoughts, together with the commencement and conclusion
of the same poem; and, although the fame of Ennius survived
the decline of Roman tragedy, and flourished even in the
age of the Antonines,<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c012'><sup>[159]</sup></a> and his verses were heard in the theatre
of Puteoli (Pozzuoli,) the entertainment did not consist of one of
his tragedies, but of recitations from his epic poem. Nevertheless
his tragedies were very numerous, and the titles and some
fragments of twenty-three remain. They are all close imitations,
or even translations, of the Greek. Of fifteen fragments of his
Medea which are extant, there is not one which does not correspond
with some passage in the Medea of Euripides: the little
which we have of his Eumenides is a transcript from the tragedy
of Æschylus;<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c012'><sup>[160]</sup></a> and, according to A. Gellius, his Hecuba is a clever
translation likewise.</p>

<p class='c011'>His favourite model was Euripides: nor is it surprising that he
should have been better able to appreciate the inferior excellencies
of this dramatic poet, when we remember that the birth
of Latin literature was coincident with the decay of that of
Greece. Callimachus died just as Livius began to write.<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c012'><sup>[161]</sup></a> Theocritus
expired when Ennius was twenty-five years old;<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c012'><sup>[162]</sup></a> and by
this decaying living literature his taste must have been partially
educated and formed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>In comedy, as in tragedy, he never emancipated himself from
the trammels of the Greek originals. His comedies were <i>palliatæ</i>;
and Terence when accused of plagiarism defends himself
by an appeal to the example of Ennius. Fragments are preserved
of four only.</p>

<p class='c011'>The poems which he wrote in various metres, and on miscellaneous
subjects, were, for that reason, entitled <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Satiræ</span></cite> or <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Saturæ</span></cite>.
Ennius does not, indeed, anticipate the claim of Lucilius to be
considered the father of Roman satire in its proper sense; but
still there can be little doubt that the scope of these minor
poems was the chastisement of vice. The degeneracy of Roman
virtue, even in his days, provoked language of Archilochian
bitterness from so stern a moralist, although he would not libellously
attack those who were undeserving of censure. The
salutation which he addresses to himself expresses the burning
indignation which he felt against wickedness:—</p>

<p class='c011'>Amongst his minor works were epitaphs on Scipio and on himself,
a didactic poem, entitled Epicharmus, a collection of moral
precepts, an encomium on his friend Scipio Africanus, a translation
in hexameters of a poem on edible fishes and their localities,
by Archestratus (Phagetica,) and a work entitled Asotus,
the existence of which is only known from its being mentioned
by Varro and Festus for the sake of etymological illustration;
by some it is thought to have been a comedy. The idea that he
was the author of a piece called “<cite class='quote'>Sabinæ</cite>” is without foundation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cicero<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c012'><sup>[163]</sup></a> mentions a mythological work (Evemerus,) a translation
in trochaics of the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἱερα Ἀναγραφη</span> of the Sicilian writer who bore
that name. It was a work well adapted to the talent which
Ennius possessed of relating mythical traditions, in the form of
poetical history. The theory embodied in the original was one
which is often adopted by Livy in his early history, and therefore
most probably entered into the ancient legends, namely, that the
gods were originally mighty warriors and benefactors of mankind,
who, as their reward, were deified and worshipped.</p>

first displayed itself in the rudest species of comedy. The entertainment
was extemporaneous, and performed by amateurs, and
rhythmical only so far as to be consistent with these conditions.
It was satirical, personal, full of burlesque extravagances, practical
jokes, and licentious jesting. When it put on a more systematic
form, by the introduction of music, and singing, and dancing,
and professional actors, still the Roman youth would not give up
their national amusement, and a marked distinction was made
in the social and political condition of the actor and the amateur.
Italian comedy made no further progress, but on it was engrafted
the Greek comedy, and hence arose that phase of the drama, the
representatives of which were Plautus, Cæcilius Statius, and
Terence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now the old Attic comedy consisted of either political or literary
criticism. In Italy, however, the Fescennine verses, and
the farces of Atella, were not political, neither was there any
literature to criticise or to parody. But the personalities in
which the people had taken pleasure prepared them to enjoy the
comedy of manners, embodying as it did pictures of social life.
The new comedy, therefore, of the Greeks furnished a suitable
model; and the comedies of Menander, Diphilus, Apollodorus,
and others formed a rich mine of materials for adaptation or
imitation.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>From them the Roman poet could derive much more than the
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis comica</span>,” in which Cæsar complained that they were still so
deficient. In the extant fragments of Menander may be found
powerful delineations of human passions, especially of the pains
and pleasures of love, melancholy but true views of the vanity
of human hopes, elevated moral sentiments, and noble ideas of
the divine nature. A vein of temperate and placid gentleness,
intermingled with amiable pleasantry, pervaded the comedies
of Philemon, and his sentiments are tender and serious, without
being gloomy. These good qualities recommended them to
Chrysostom, Eustathius, and other early Christians, by whom so
many of their fragments have been preserved.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is no doubt that the comic, as well as the tragic poet
of Greece, considered himself as a public instructor; but it is
difficult to say how far the Roman author recognised a moral
object, because it cannot be determined what moral sentiments
were designedly introduced, and what were merely transcriptions
from the original. It is plain, however, that Roman comedy was
calculated to produce a moral result, although the morality which
it inculcated was extremely low: its standard was merely worldly
prudence, its lessons utilitarian, its philosophy, like that of Menander
himself, Epicurean, and therefore it did not inculcate an
unbending sense of honour, the self-denying heroism of the Stoic
school, or that rigid Roman virtue which was akin to it—it contented
itself with encouraging the benevolent affections.</p>

<p class='c011'>It did not profess to reform the knave, except by showing him
that knavery was not always successful. It taught that cunning
must be met with its own weapons, and that the qualities necessary
for the conflict were wit and sharpness. The union between
the moral and the comic element was exhibited in making intrigue
successful wherever the victim was deserving of it, and
in representing him as foiled by accidents and cross-purposes,
because the prudence and caution of the knave are not always
on a par with his cunning. It also had its sentimental side, and
the sympathies of the audience were enlisted in favour of good
temper, affection, and generosity.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the new Attic comedy presented a truthful portraiture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>of real native life. This was scarcely ever the case with the
Romans; the plots, characters, localities, and political institutions,
were all Greek, and therefore it can only be said that the whole
was in perfect harmony and consistency with Roman modes of
thinking and acting. The comedies of Plautus probably, as will
be seen hereafter, form the only exception.</p>

<p class='c011'>It cannot be denied that there is a want of variety in the plots
of Roman comedy;<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c012'><sup>[164]</sup></a> but this defect is owing to the political and
social condition of ancient Greece. Greece and the neighbouring
countries were divided into numerous independent states; its
narrow seas were, even more than they are now, infested with
pirates, who had their nests and lurking-places in the various
unfrequented coasts and islands; and slaves were an article of
merchandise. Many a romantic incident therefore occurred, such
as is found in comedy. A child would be stolen, sold as a slave,
educated in all the accomplishments which would fit her to be
an <i>Hetæra</i>, engage the affections of some young Athenian, and
eventually, from some jewels or personal marks, be recognised
by her parents, and restored to the rank of an Athenian citizen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, in order to confine the privilege of citizenship, marriages
with foreigners were invalid, and this restriction on marriage
caused the <i>Hetæra</i> to occupy so prominent a part in comedy;
besides, love was little more than sensual passion, and marriage
generally a matter of convenience: the Hetæræ, too, were often
clever and accomplished, whilst the virtuous matron was fitter
for the duties of domestic life than for society. The regulations
of the Greek theatre also, which were adopted by the Romans,
caused some restrictions upon the variety of plots. In comedy
the scene represented the public street, in which Greek females
of good character did not usually appear unveiled: matrons,
nurses, and women of light character alone are introduced upon
the stage, and in all the plays of Terence, except the Eunuch,
the heroine is never seen.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the range of subjects is small, so there is a sameness in the
dramatis personæ: the principal characters are a morose and
parsimonious, or a gentle and easy father, who is sometimes, also,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>the henpecked husband of a rich wife, an affectionate or domineering
wife, a young man who is frank and good-natured but
profligate, a grasping or benevolent Hetæra, a roguish servant,
a fawning favourite, a hectoring coward, an unscrupulous procuress,
and a cold calculating slave-dealer.</p>

<p class='c011'>The actors wore appropriate masks, sometimes partial, sometimes
covering the whole face, the features of which were not
only grotesque, but much exaggerated and magnified. This was
rendered absolutely necessary by the immense size of the theatre,
the stage of which sometimes measured sixty yards, and which
would contain many thousands of spectators; the mouth, also,
answered the purpose of a sounding board, or speaking-trumpet
to assist in conveying the voice to every part of the vast building.
The characters, too, were made known by a conventional costume:
old men wore ample robes of white; young men were attired in
gay parti-coloured clothes; rich men in purple; soldiers in scarlet;
poor men and slaves in dark-coloured and scanty dresses.</p>

<p class='c011'>The names assigned to the characters of the Roman comedy
have always an appropriate meaning. Young men, for example,
are Pamphilus, “dear to all;” Charinus, “gracious;” Phædria,
“joyous:” old men are Simo, “flat-nosed,” such a physiognomy
being considered indicative of a cross-grained disposition:
Chremes, from a word signifying troubled with phlegm. Slaves
generally bear the name of their native country, as Syrus, Phrygia;
Davus, a Dacian; Byrrhia, a native of Pyrrha in Caria;
Dorias, a Dorian girl; a vain-glorious soldier is Thraso, from
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">θρασος</span>, boldness; a parasite, Gnatho, from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γναθος</span>, the jaw; a nurse,
Sophrona (discreet;) a freedman, Sosia, as having been spared
in war; a young girl is Glycerium, from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">γλυκυς</span>, sweet; a judge
is Crito; a courtesan, Chrysis, from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">χρυσος</span>,<a id='t102'></a> gold. These examples
will be sufficient to illustrate the practice adopted by the comic
writers.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is very difficult to understand the relation which music bore
to the exhibition of Roman comedy. It is clear that there was
always a musical accompaniment, and that the instruments used
were flutes; the lyre was only used in tragedy, because in comedy
there was no chorus or lyric portion. The flutes were at first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>small and simple; but in the time of Horace were much larger
and more powerful, as well as constructed with more numerous
stops and greater compass.<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c012'><sup>[165]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Flutes were of two kinds. Those played with the right hand
(tibiæ dextræ) were made of the upper part of the reed, and like
the modern fife or octave flute emitted a high sound: they were
therefore suitable to lively and cheerful melodies; and this kind
of music, known by the name of the Lydian mode, was performed
upon a pair of tibiæ dextræ. The left-handed flutes (tibiæ sinistræ)
were pitched an octave lower: their tones were grave and
fit for solemn music. The mode denominated Tyrian, or Sarrane,<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c012'><sup>[166]</sup></a>
was executed with a pair of tibiæ sinistræ. If the subject of the
play was serio-comic, the music was in the Phrygian mode, and
the flutes used were <i>impares</i> (unequal,) <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>, one for the right,
the other for the left hand.<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c012'><sup>[167]</sup></a> In tragedy the lyrical portion was
sung to music and the dialogue declaimed. But if that were the
case in comedy, it is difficult to imagine what corresponded to
the lyrical portion, and therefore where music was used. Quintilian
informs us that scenic modulation was a simple, easy chant,<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c012'><sup>[168]</sup></a>
resembling probably intonation in our cathedrals. Such a practice
would aid the voice considerably; and if so, the theory of
Colman is probably correct, that there was throughout some
accompaniment, but that the music arranged for the soliloquies
(in which Terence especially abounds) was more laboured and
complicated than that of the dialogue.<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c012'><sup>[169]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>In order to understand the principles which regulated the
Roman comic metres, some remarks must be made on the manner
in which the language itself was affected by the common conversational
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>pronunciation. In most languages there is a natural
tendency to abbreviation and contraction. As the object of language
is the expression of thought, few are inclined to take more
trouble or to expend more time than is absolutely necessary for
conveying their meaning: this attention to practical utility and
convenience is the reason for all elliptical forms in grammatical
constructions, and also for all abbreviated methods of pronunciation
by slurring or clipping, or, to use the language of grammarians,
by apocope, syncope, synæresis, or crasis.</p>

<p class='c011'>The experience of every one proves how different is the impression
which the sound of a foreign language makes upon the
ear, when spoken by another, from what it makes upon the eye
when read even by one who is perfectly acquainted with the
theory of pronunciation. Until the ear is habituated, it is easier
for an Englishman to speak French than to understand it when
spoken. If we consider attentively the manner in which we
speak our own language, it is astonishing how many letters and
even syllables are slurred over and omitted: the accented syllable
is strongly and firmly enunciated, the rest, especially in
long words, are left to take care of themselves, and the experience
of the hearer and his acquaintance with the language find
no difficulty in supplying the deficiency. This is universally the
case, except in careful and deliberate reading, and in measured
and stately declamation.</p>

<p class='c011'>With regard to the classical languages, the foregoing observations
hold good; in a slighter degree, indeed, with respect
to the Greek, for the delicacy of their ear, their attention to
accent and quantity, not only in poetry but in oratory, and even
in conversation, caused them to give greater effect to every
syllable, and especially to the vowel sounds. But even in Greek
poetry elision sometimes prevents the disagreeable effect of a
hiatus, and in the transition from the one dialect to the other,
the numerous vowels of the Ionic assume the contracted form of
the Attic.</p>

<p class='c011'>The resemblance between the practice of the Romans and that
of modern nations is very remarkable; with them the mark of
good taste was ease—the absence of effort, pedantry, and affectation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>As they principally admired facility in versification, so
they sought it in pronunciation likewise. To speak with mouthing
(hiulce,) with a broad accent (late, vaste,) was to speak like a
clown and not like a gentleman (rustice et inurbaniter.) Cicero<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c012'><sup>[170]</sup></a>
admired the soft, gentle, equable tones of the female voice, and
considered the pronunciation of the eloquent and cultivated
Lælia as the model of purity and perfection: he thought that
she spoke as Plautus or Nævius might have spoken. Again, he
speaks of the habit which Cotta had of omitting the iota; pronouncing,
for example, dominus, dom’nus, as a prevalent fashion;
and although he says,<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c012'><sup>[171]</sup></a> that such an <i>obscuration</i> argues negligence,
he, on the other hand, applies to the opposite fault a term (putidius)
which implies the most offensive affectation. From these
observations, we must expect to find that Latin as it was pronounced
was very different from Latin as it is written; that this
difference consisted in abbreviation either by the omission of
sounds altogether, or by contraction of two sounds into one; and
that these processes would take place especially in those syllables
which in poetry are not marked by the ictus or beat, or in common
conversation by the stress or emphasis. Even in the more
artificial poetry and oratory of the Augustan age, in which
quantity was more rigidly observed by the Roman imitators
than by the Greek originals, we find traces of this tendency;
and Virgil does not hesitate to use in his stately heroics such
forms as aspris, for asperis, semustum for semiustum, oraclum
for oraculum, maniplus for manipulus; and, like Terence, to
make rejicere (rēīcĕrĕ) a dactyle.<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c012'><sup>[172]</sup></a> A number of the most
common words, sanctioned by general usage, and incorporated
into the language when in its most perfect state, were contractions—such
as amassent for amavissent, concio for conventio,
cogo from con and ago, surgo from sub and rego, malla for
maxilla, pomeridianus from post-mediam-diem, and other instances
too numerous to mention.</p>

<p class='c011'>But in the earlier periods, when literature was addressed still
more to the ear than to the eye, when the Greek metres were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>as yet unknown, and even when, after their introduction, exact
observation of Greek rules was not yet necessary, we find, as
might be expected, these principles of the language carried still
further. They pervade the poems of Livius and Ennius, and
the Roman tragedies, even although their style is necessarily
more declamatory than that of the comic writers; but in the
latter we have a complete representation of Latin as it was commonly
pronounced and spoken, and but little trammelled or confined
by a rigid adhesion to the Greek metrical laws. In the
prologues, indeed, which are of the nature of declamation, and
not of free and natural conversation, more care is visible; the
iambic trimeters in which they are written fall upon the ear with
a cadence similar to those of the Greek, with scarcely any license
except an occasional spondee in the even places. But in the
scenes little more seems to have been attended to, than that the
verse should have the required number of feet, and the syllables
pronounced the right quantity, in accordance with the widest
license which the rules of Greek prosody allowed. What syllables
should be slurred, was left to be decided by the common
custom of pronunciation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides the licenses commonly met with in the poets of the
Augustan age, the following mutilations are the most usual in
the poetical language of the age of which we are treating:—</p>

<p class='c011'>1. The final <i>s</i> might be elided even before a consonant, and
hence the preceding vowel was made short: thus mălīs became
mali, on the same principle that in Augustan poetry aūdīsnĕ was
contracted into audĭn’. Thus the short vowel would suffer elision
before another, and the following line of Terence would consequently
be thus scanned:—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ut mă | līs gāŭ | dēat ălĭ | ēn’ ātq’. | ēx ĭn | cōmmö | dīs.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>2. Vowels and even consonants were slurred over; hence
Liberius became Lib’rius; Adolescens, Ad’lescens; Vehemens,
Vemens; Voluptas, V’luptas (like the French voila, v’la;) meum,
eum, suum, siet, fuit, Deos, ego, ille, tace, became monosyllables;
and facio, sequere, &amp;c., dissyllables.</p>

<p class='c011'>3. <i>M</i> and <i>D</i> were syncopated in the middle of words: thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>enimvero became en’vero; quidem and modo qu’en and mo’o,
circumventus, circ’ventus.</p>

<p class='c011'>4. Conversely <i>d</i> was added to me, te, and se, when followed
by a vowel, as Reliquit med homo, &amp;c., and in Plautus, med
erga.</p>

<p class='c011'>Observations of such principles as these enable us to reduce
all the metres of Terence, and nearly all of Plautus, to iambic
and trochaic, especially to iambic senarii and trochaic tetrameters.
Many of those which defy the attempt have become, by
the injudicious treatment of transcribers or commentators,
wrongly arranged: for example, one of four lines in the Andria
of Terence, which has always proved a difficulty, might be thus
arranged:—</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>PLAUTUS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>T. Maccius Plautus was a contemporary of Ennius, for it is
generally supposed that he was born twelve years later,<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c012'><sup>[173]</sup></a> and
died fifteen years earlier<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c012'><sup>[174]</sup></a> than the founder of the new school of
Latin poetry. The flourishing period, therefore, of both coincide.
He was a native of Sarsina, in Umbria, but was very young
when he removed to Rome. Very little is known respecting
his life; but it is universally admitted that he was of humble
origin, and owing to the prevalence of this tradition we find
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plautinæ prosapiæ homo</span></i>, used as a proverbial expression. The
numerous examples in his comedies of vulgar taste and low humour
are in favour of this supposition.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had no early gentlemanlike associations to interfere with
his delineations of Roman character in low life. His contemporary,
Ennius, was a gentleman; Plautus was not: education
did not overcome his vulgarity, although it produced a great
effect upon his language and style, which were more refined and
cultivated than those of his predecessors. Plautus must have
lived and associated with the class whose manners he describes;
hence his pictures are correct and truthful.</p>

<p class='c011'>The class from which his representations of Roman life was
taken is that of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ærarii</span></i>, who consisted of clients, the sons of
freedmen, and the half-enfranchised natives of Italian towns.
His plots are Greek, his personages Greek, and the scene is laid
in Greece and her colonies; but the morality, manners, sentiments,
wit, and humour, were those of that mixed, half-foreign,
class of the inhabitants of the capital, which stood between the
slave and the free-born citizen. One of his characters is, as
was observed by Niebuhr,<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c012'><sup>[175]</sup></a> not Roman, for the parasite is a
Greek, not a Roman character; but then a flatterer is by profession
a citizen of the world, and his business is to conform himself
to the manners of every society. How readily that character
became naturalized, we are informed by some of the most
amusing passages in the satires of Horace and Juvenal.</p>

<p class='c011'>The humble occupation which his poverty compelled him to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>follow was calculated to draw out and foster the comic talent
for which he was afterwards distinguished, for Varro<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c012'><sup>[176]</sup></a> tells us
that he acted as a stage-carpenter (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">operarius</span></i>) to a theatrical
company; he adds, also, that he was subsequently engaged in
some trade in which he was unsuccessful, and was reduced to
the necessity of earning his daily bread by grinding in a mill.
To this degrading labour, which was not usually performed by
men, except as a punishment for refractory slaves, it has been
supposed that he owed his cognomen, Asinius, which is sometimes
appended to his other names. Ritzschl, however, has most ingeniously
and satisfactorily proved that the name of Asinius is
a corruption of Sarsinas (native of Sarsina:) he supposes that
Sarsinas became Arsinas, that this was afterwards written Arsin,
then Asin, and that this was finally considered as the representative
of Asinius.</p>

<p class='c011'>This view is further supported by the fact that, in all cases
in which the name Asinius is used, the poet is called not Asinius
Plautus, but Plautus Asinius, like Livius Patavinus, this being the
proper position for the ethnic name. Another error respecting
the poet’s name has been perpetuated throughout all the editions
of his works, although it is not found in any manuscript.
It was discovered by Ritzschl<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c012'><sup>[177]</sup></a> whilst examining the palimpsest
MS. in the Ambrosian Library at Milan. He thus found that his
real names were Titus Maccius, and not Marcus Accius. The
name Plautus was given him because he had flat feet, this being
the signification of the word in the Umbrian language. Niebuhr,<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c012'><sup>[178]</sup></a>
although he does not deny his poverty, gives no credit to the
story of his working at a mill.</p>

<p class='c011'>The earliest comedies which he wrote are said to have been
entitled “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Addictus</span></cite>,” and “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Saturio</span></cite>,” but they are not contained
amongst the twenty which are now extant. As soon as he became
an author there can be no doubt that he emerged from his
state of poverty and obscurity, for he had no rival during his
whole career, unless Cæcilius Statius, a man of very inferior talent,
can be considered one. Comedies began now to be in great demand:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>the taste for the comic drama was awakened; it was precisely
the sort of literature likely to be acceptable to an active,
bustling, observant people like the Romans. They liked shows
of every kind, and public speaking, and had always their eyes
and their ears open, loved jokes and rude satire and boisterous
mirth, and would appreciate bold and fearless delineations of
character, which they met with in their every-day life. The
demand for the public games, therefore, began to be quite as
great as the supply, and the theatrical managers would take care
always to have a new play in rehearsal, in case they should be
called upon for a public representation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Plautus had no aristocratic patrons, like Ennius and Terence—probably
his humour was too broad, and his taste not refined
enough, to please the Scipios and Lælii, and their fastidious associates.
Horace finds fault with Plautus because his wit was
not sufficiently gentlemanlike, as well as his numbers not sufficiently
harmonious. Probably the higher classes might have
observed similar deficiencies; with the masses, however, the comedies
of Plautus, notwithstanding their faults, retained their original
popularity even in the Augustan age. The Roman public
were his patrons. His very coarseness would recommend him
to the rude admirers of the Fescennine songs and the Atellan
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fabulæ</span></i>. His careless prosody and inharmonious verses would
either escape the not over-refined ears of his audience, or be forgiven
for the sake of the fun which they contained. Life, bustle,
surprise, unexpected situations, sharp, sprightly, brilliant, sparkling
raillery, that knew no restraint nor bounds, carried the audience
with him. He allowed no respite, no time for dulness or
weariness. To use an expression of Horace, he hurried on from
scene to scene, from incident to incident, from jest to jest, so that
his auditors had no opportunity for feeling fatigue.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another cause of his popularity was, that although Greek was
the fountain from which he drew his stores, and the metres of
Greek poetry the framework in which he set them, his wit, his
mode of thought, his language, were purely Roman. He had
lived so long amongst Romans that he had caught their national
spirit, and this spirit was reflected throughout his comedies. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>incidents of them might have taken place in the streets of Rome,
so skilful was he in investing them with a Roman dress.</p>

<p class='c011'>His style too was truly Latin, and Latin of the very purest
and most elegant kind.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c012'><sup>[179]</sup></a> He did not, like Cato and Ennius, carry
his admiration for Greek so far as to “enrich” his native tongue
with new and foreign words. Nor would this feature be without
some effect in gaining him the sympathy of the masses.
They admire elegance of language if it is elegant simplicity.
They appreciate well-chosen and well-arranged sentences, if the
words are such as fall familiarly, and, therefore, intelligibly on
their ears.</p>

<p class='c011'>The coarseness of Plautus, however, was the coarseness of innuendo,
and even if the allusion was indelicate, it was veiled in
decent language. This quality of his wit called forth the approbation
of Cicero.<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c012'><sup>[180]</sup></a> But it is difficult to conceive how he could
compare him, in this particular, with the old Athenian comedy,
the obscenity of which is so gross and palpable, as to constitute
the sole blemish of those delightful compositions.</p>

<p class='c011'>The following laudatory epigram written by Varro is found
in the Noctes Atticæ of A. Gellius:<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c012'><sup>[181]</sup></a>—</p>

      <div class='line'>Postquam est mortem aptus Plautus, comœdia luget,</div>

      <div class='line'>Et numeri innumeri simul omnes collacrumarunt.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The same grammarian paid to his style a compliment similar
to that which had been paid to Plato, by saying, that if the Muses
spoke in Latin they would borrow the language of Plautus.<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c012'><sup>[182]</sup></a>
Whatever might have been the faults of the Plautian comedy, it
maintained its position on the Roman stage for at least five centuries,
and was acted as late as the reign of Dioclesian.</p>

<p class='c011'>It does not appear that Plautus ever attained the full privileges
of a Roman citizen. Probably he had no powerful friends
to press his claims, and therefore enjoyed no more than the
Italian franchise to the end of his days. No fewer than one
hundred and thirty comedies have been attributed to him, but
of these many were spurious. Varro considers the twenty which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>are now extant genuine, together with the Vidularia, of which
only a few lines remain, and those only in the palimpsest MS.
already mentioned. The rest, the titles of which alone survive,
are of doubtful authority.</p>

<p class='c011'>All the comedies of Plautus, except the <cite>Amphitruo</cite>, were
adapted from the new comedy of the Greeks. The statement that
he imitated the Sicilian Epicharmus,<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c012'><sup>[183]</sup></a> and founded the <i>Menæchmi</i>
on one of his comedies, rests only on a vague tradition. There
can be no doubt that he studied also both the old and the middle
comedy; but still Menander, Diphilus, and Philemon furnished
him the originals of his plots. The popularity of Plautus was
not confined to Rome, either republican or imperial. Dramatic
writers of modern times have recognised the effectiveness of his
plots, and, therefore, have adopted or imitated them, and they
have been translated into most of the European languages.</p>

<p class='c011'>The following is a brief sketch of the subjects of his extant
comedies.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>I.</span> Amphitruo. This is the only piece which Plautus borrowed
from the middle Attic comedy; the plot is founded on the well-known
story of Jupiter and Alcmena, and has been imitated both
by Molière and Dryden.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>II., III., IV.</span> The Asinaria, Casina, and Mercator, depict a state
of morals so revolting that it is impossible to dwell upon them.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>V.</span> In the Aulularia, a very amusing play, a miser finds a pot of
gold (aulula,) and hides it with the greatest care. His daughter
is demanded in marriage by an old man named Megadorus, the
principal recommendation to whose suit is, that he is willing to
take her without a dowry. Meanwhile the slave of her young
lover steals the gold, and, as may be conjectured, for no more of
the play is preserved, the lover restores the gold, and the old
man, in the joy of his heart, gives him his daughter.</p>

<p class='c011'>This comedy suggested to Molière the plot of L’Avare,
the best play which he ever wrote, and one in which he far
surpasses the original. Two attempts have been made to supply
the lost scenes, which may be found in the Delphin and Variorum
edition.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span><span class='fss'>VI.</span> The Bacchides are two twin sisters, one of whom is beloved
by her sister’s lover. He does not know that there are
two, and, misled by the similarity of the name, thinks himself
betrayed. Hence arise amusing situations and incidents, but at
length an éclaircissement takes place.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>VII.</span> The Captivi, for its style, sentiments, moral, and the structure
of the plot, is incomparably the best comedy of Plautus.
In a war between the Ætolians and Eleians, Philopolemus, an
Ætolian, the son of Hegio, is taken prisoner, whilst Philocrates
is captured by the Ætolians. Philocrates and his slave Tyndarus
are purchased by Hegio, with a view to recover his son by an
exchange of prisoners. The master and slave, however, agree
to change places; and thus Philocrates is sent back to his country,
valued only as a slave. Hegio discovers the trick, and condemns
Tyndarus to fetters and hard labour. Philocrates, however, returns,
and brings back Philopolemus with him, and it also turns
out that Tyndarus is a son of Hegio whom he had lost in his infancy.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>VIII.</span> The Curculio derives its name from a parasite, who is the
hero, and who acts his part in a plot full of fraud and forgery;
the only satisfactory point in the comedy being the deserved
punishment of an infamous pander.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>IX.</span> In the Cistellaria, Demipho, a Lemnian, promises his
daughter to Alcesimarchus, who is in love with Silenium. The
young lady has fallen into the hands of a courtesan, who endeavours
to force her into a vicious course of life; she, however,
steadily refuses; and it is at length discovered, by means of a
box of toys (cistella,) that she is the illegitimate daughter of
Demipho, and had been exposed as an infant. Her virtue is rewarded
by her being happily married to her lover.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>X.</span> The Epidicus was evidently a favourite play with the
author, for he makes one of the characters in another comedy
say that he loves it as dearly as himself.<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c012'><sup>[184]</sup></a> The plot turns on the
common story of a lost child recognised. The intrigue, which
is remarkably clever, is managed by Epidicus, a cunning slave,
who gives the name to the play.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span><span class='fss'>XI.</span> The Mostellaria is exceedingly lively and amusing. A
young man, in his father’s absence, makes the paternal mansion
a scene of noisy and extravagant revelry. In the midst of it the
father returns, and in order to prevent discovery, a slave persuades
him that the house is haunted. When he discovers the
trick he is very angry, but ultimately pardons both his son and
the slave. The name is derived from Mostellum, the diminutive
of Monstrum, a prodigy, or supernatural visitor.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>XII.</span> The Menæchmi is a Comedy of Errors, arising out of the
exact likeness between two brothers, one of whom was stolen
in infancy, and the other wanders in search of him, and at last
finds him in great affluence at Epidamnus. It furnished the plot
to Shakspeare’s play, and likewise to the comedy of Regnard,
which bears the name of the original.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>XIII.</span> The Miles Gloriosus was taken from the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀλαζων</span> (Boaster)
of the Greek comic drama. Its hero, Pyrgopolinices, is the
model of all the blustering, swaggering captains of ancient and
modern comedy. The braggadocio carries off the mistress of a
young Athenian, who follows him, and takes up his abode in
the next house to that in which the girl is concealed. Like Pyramus
and Thisbe the lovers have secret interviews through a
hole in the party-wall. (The device being borrowed from the
“<cite class='quote'>Phantom</cite>” of Menander.)<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c012'><sup>[185]</sup></a> When they are discovered, the
soldier is induced to resign the lady by being persuaded that
another is desperately in love with him, but the only reward
which he gets is a good beating for his pains.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>XIV.</span> In the Pseudolus, a cunning slave of that name procures,
by a false memorandum, a female slave for his young master;
and when the fraud is discovered the matter is settled by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>payment of the price by a complaisant father. Notwithstanding
the simplicity of the plot, the action is bustling and full of
intrigue; and from a passage of Cicero,<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c012'><sup>[186]</sup></a> it appears that this
play and Truculentus were favourites with the author himself.
The procurer in this comedy was one of the characters in which
Roscius especially excelled.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>XV.</span> The Pœnulus derives its name from its romantic plot. A
young Carthaginian slave is adopted by an old bachelor, who
leaves him a good inheritance. He falls in love with a girl, a
Carthaginian like himself, who had been kidnapped with her
sister, and now belonged to a procurer. The arrival of the
father leads to a discovery that they are free-born, and that they
are the first cousins of the young man. Thus it comes to pass
that the girls are rescued, and the lovers united. The most
curious portion of this comedy is that in which Hanno, the
father, is represented as talking Punic;<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c012'><sup>[187]</sup></a> and his words bear so
close a resemblance to the Hebrew that commentators have expressed
them in Hebrew characters, and rendered them, after a
few emendations, capable of translation.<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c012'><sup>[188]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>XVI.</span> The tricks played upon a procurer by a slave, aided by
a Persian parasite, furnish the slender plot of the Persa.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>XVII.</span> The Rudens derives its name from the rope of a fishing-net,
and, with the exception perhaps of the Captivi, is the most
affecting and pleasing of all the twenty plays. The morality is
pure, the sentiments elevated, the poetic justice complete. A
female child has fallen into the hands of a procurer. Her lover
in vain endeavours to ransom her, and being shipwrecked, the
toys with which she played in infancy are lost in the waves, but
are eventually brought to shore by the net of a fisherman. She
is thus recognised by her father, and is married to her lover,
whilst the procurer is utterly ruined by the loss of his property
in the wreck.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>XVIII.</span> Stichus is the name of the slave on whom the intrigue
of the play which bears this name mainly depends. The plot
is very simple. Two brothers marry two sisters, and are ruined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>by extravagant living; they determine therefore to go abroad
and repair their fortunes. After they have been many years
absent the ladies’ father wishes them to marry again. They,
however, steadily refuse, and their constancy is rewarded by the
return of their husbands with large fortunes.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>XIX.</span> The Trinummus is a translation from the Thesaurus of
the Greek comic poet Philemon.<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c012'><sup>[189]</sup></a> It derived its Latin title from
the incident of the informer being bribed with three <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nummi</span></i>.<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c012'><sup>[190]</sup></a>
An old merchant on leaving home places his son and daughter,
together with a treasure which he has buried in his house,
under the guardianship of his friend Callicles. The son squanders
his father’s property, and is even forced to sell his house,
which Callicles purchases. Soon a young man of good family
and fortune makes proposals for the daughter’s hand, and Callicles
is at a loss to know how to give her a dowry without saying
something about the treasure. At length he hires a man to
pretend that he has come from the absent father, and has brought
one thousand pieces of gold. The return of the father interferes
with the plan; but everything is explained, the daughter
is married, and the son forgiven.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>XX.</span> The Truculentus, although the moral picture which it
presents is detestable, is remarkably clever, both for the variety
of incidents and the graphic delineations of character which it
contains. The artful courtesan who dupes and ruins her lovers;
the three lovers themselves—one a man of the town, another an
unpolished but generous rustic, the third a stupid and conceited
soldier; and, lastly, the slave, whose rude sagacity and bluff
hatred of courtesans expose him to the imputation of being actually
savage (truculentus,) are powerfully drawn; but notwithstanding
its merits, it is not a play which can possibly please
the tastes and sentiments of modern times.</p>

<p class='c011'>Plautus must not be dismissed without some notice of his prologues.
The prologue of the Greek drama prepared the audience
for the action of the play, by narrating all the previous
events of the story which were necessary in order to understand
the plot. That of the modern stage is an address of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>poet to the spectators, praying for indulgence, deprecating severe
criticism, enlivened frequently by characteristic sketches and
satirical observations on the manners and habits of the age. In
these features it sometimes resembles the parabasis of the old
Attic comedy. The prologues of Plautus united all these objects;
and whilst they introduced the comedy, their amusing
gayety was calculated to put the audience in good humour and
secure their applause. The shrewd knowledge which the author
displayed in them of the character of his fellow-countrymen
claimed their sympathies, and called forth their prejudices in
his favour; whilst their polish and finish must have been appreciated
by an assembly whose attention had not begun to flag or
to weary. Some are long pieces. That of the Amphitruo,
which is the longest, extends to upwards of one hundred and
fifty lines. That of the Trinummus takes the unusual form of
a brief allegorical dialogue between Luxury and her daughter
Poverty.</p>

</div>

<h4 class='c017'>CÆCILIUS STATIUS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Between Plautus and Terence flourished Cæcilius Statius,
whom Volcatius, as well as Cicero,<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c012'><sup>[191]</sup></a> places at the head of the
list of Roman comic poets. He was an emancipated slave, and
was born at Milan. The time of his birth is unknown, but he
died <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;C.</span> 586, and was therefore a contemporary of Ennius.
He did not depart from the established custom of transferring
the comedy of the Greek stage to that of Rome, and as far as a
judgment can be formed from the titles of his forty-five comedies
which are extant, they were all “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Palliatæ</span></i>.” The collection
of fragments remaining of his works is a large one, but
they are not sufficiently long or connected to test the favourable
opinion entertained by the critics of ancient times.</p>

<p class='c011'>Aulus Gellius<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c012'><sup>[192]</sup></a> enables us to estimate the powers of C. Statius
as a translator by a comparison of two passages taken from his
“<cite class='quote'>Plocius</cite>” with the original of Menander. The result is, that
the usual fault of translations is too plainly manifest, namely,
the loss of the spirit and vigour. “Our comedies,” he remarks,
“are written in an elegant and graceful style, and may be read
with pleasure; but if compared with the Greek originals, they
fall so far short that the arms of Glaucus could not have been
more inferior to those of Diomede: the Greek is full of emotion,
wit, and liveliness; the Latin dull and uninteresting.” Cicero,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>likewise, and Varro have pronounced judgment upon his merits
and demerits. The sum and substance of their criticisms appear
to be that his excellencies consisted in the conduct of the plot,<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c012'><sup>[193]</sup></a>
dignity,<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c012'><sup>[194]</sup></a> and in pathos,<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c012'><sup>[195]</sup></a> whilst his fault was not sufficient care
in preserving the purity of the Latin style.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cicero,<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c012'><sup>[196]</sup></a> though not without hesitation, assigns the palm to
him amongst the writers of Latin comedy, as he awards that of
epic poetry to Ennius, and that of tragedy to Pacuvius.<a href='#f196' class='c012'><sup>[196]</sup></a> He
says, on the other hand,<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c012'><sup>[197]</sup></a> that the bad Latin of Cæcilius and
Pacuvius formed exceptions to the usual style of their age,
which was as commendable for its Latinity as for its innocence.
And in a letter to Atticus,<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c012'><sup>[198]</sup></a> he writes:—“I said, not as Cæcilius,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mane ut ex portu in Piræum</span></i>, but as Terence, whose plays, on
account of their elegant Latinity, were thought to have been
written by C. Lælius, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Heri aliquot adolescentuli coimus in Piræum</span>.”
Horace,<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c012'><sup>[199]</sup></a> without stating his own opinion, gives, as that
commonly received in his day, that Cæcilius is superior in dignity
(<i>gravitate</i>,) Terence in skill (<i>arte</i>.)</p>

<p class='c011'>The prologue of Terence’s comedy of the Hecyra proves that
the earlier plays of Cæcilius had a great struggle to achieve
success. The actor who delivers it, an old favourite with the
public, and probably the manager, apologizes for bringing forward
a play which had been once rejected (<i>exacta</i>,) on the
ground that by perseverance in a similar course he had caused
the reception and approval of not one but many of the comedies
of Cæcilius which had been unsuccessful, and adds, that of
those which did succeed, some had a narrow escape.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>P. TERENTIUS AFER.</h4>

<p class='c018'>P. Terentius Afer was a slave in the family of a Roman senator,
P. Terentius Lucanus. His early history is involved in obscurity,
but he is generally supposed to have been born <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;C.</span>
561.<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c012'><sup>[200]</sup></a> His cognomen, Afer, points to an African origin, for it
was a common custom to distinguish slaves by an ethnical name.
Whether there is any sufficient authority for the tradition that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>he was a native of Carthage is uncertain. He could not, as was
rightly observed by Fenestella,<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c012'><sup>[201]</sup></a> have been actually a prisoner
of war, because he was both born and died in the interval between
the first and second Punic Wars; nor, if he had been captured
by the Numidians or Gætulians in any war which these
tribes carried on with Carthage, could he have come into the
possession of a Roman general by purchase, for there was no commercial
intercourse between these nations and Rome until after
the destruction of Carthage.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another hypothesis has been suggested, which is by no means
improbable.<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c012'><sup>[202]</sup></a> During the interval which elapsed between the
first and second Punic Wars, the Carthaginians were involved
in wars with their own mercenaries, the Numidians, and the
southern Iberians. Some embassies from Rome also visited
Carthage. Terence, therefore, may possibly have been taken
prisoner in one of these wars, have been purchased by a Roman
in the Carthaginian slave-market, and so have been carried to
Rome. What his condition was in the house of Lucanus is not
known; but it is clear that he had opportunities of cultivating
his natural talents, and acquiring that refined and masterly acquaintance
with all the niceties and elegancies of the Latin
language which his comedies exhibited, and it is probable, also,
that very early in life he obtained his freedom.</p>

<p class='c011'>His first essay as a dramatic author was the “<cite class='quote'>Andrian</cite>,” perhaps
the most interesting, certainly the most affecting of all his
comedies. Terence, an unknown and obscure young man, offered
his play to the Curule Ædiles. They, accordingly, we are
told, referred the new candidate to the experienced judgment of
Cæcilius Statius, then at the height of his popularity. Terence,
in humble garb, was introduced to the poet whilst he was at
supper, and seated on a low stool near the couch on which
Cæcilius was reclining, he commenced reading. He had finished
but a few lines when Cæcilius invited him to sit by him and
sup with him. He rapidly ran through the rest of his play,
and gained the unqualified admiration of his hearer. This
story is related by Donatus, but whether there is any truth in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>it is very doubtful. It is, at any rate, certain that “<cite class='quote'>The Andrian</cite>”
was not brought forward immediately after obtaining
this decision in its favour, for the date of its first representation<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c012'><sup>[203]</sup></a>
is two years subsequent to the death of Cæcilius.</p>

<p class='c011'>Talents of so popular a kind as those of Terence, and a
genius presenting the rare combination of all the fine and delicate
touches which characterize true Attic sentiment, without
corrupting the native ingenuous purity of the Latin language,
could not long remain in obscurity. He was soon eagerly
sought for as a guest and a companion by those who could appreciate
his powers. The great Roman nobility, such as the Scipiones,
the Lælii, the Scavolæ, and the Metelli, had a taste for
literature. Like the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tyranni</span></i> in Sicily and Greece, and like
some of the Italian princes in the middle ages, they assembled
around them circles of literary men, of whom the polite and
hospitable host himself formed the nucleus and centre.</p>

<p class='c011'>The purity and gracefulness of the style of Terence, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per
quam dulces Latini leporis facetiæ nituerunt</span></i>,”<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c012'><sup>[204]</sup></a> show that the
conversation of his accomplished friends was not lost upon his
correct ear and quick intuition. To these habits of good society
may also be attributed the leading moral characteristics of his
comedies. He invariably exhibits the humanity and benevolence
of a cultivated mind. He cannot bear loathsome and disgusting
vice: he deters the young from the unlawful indulgence of their
passions by painting such indulgence as inconsistent with the refined
habits and tastes of a gentleman.</p>

<p class='c011'>His truthfulness compels him to depict habits and practices
which were recognised and allowed, as well by the manners of
the Athenians, from whom his comedies were taken, as by the
lax morality of Roman fashionable society. Nor can we expect
from a heathen writer of comedy so high a tone of morality as
to lash vice with the severe censure which the Christian feels it
deserves, however venial society may pronounce it to be. It is
as much as can be hoped for, if we find the principles of good
taste brought forward on the stage to influence public morals.
Even the code of Christian society too often contents itself with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>rebuking such vice as interferes with its own comfort or safety,
and stigmatizes conduct, not for its immorality, but for its being
unbecoming a gentleman. It is a standard which has its use,
but it is not higher than the Terentian.</p>

<p class='c011'>And if the plays of Terence are compared with those of authors
professing to be Christians, which form part of the classical
literature of the English nation, and were unblushingly witnessed
on their representation by some of both sexes, who, nevertheless,
professed a regard for character, how immeasurably superior
are the comedies of the heathen poet! Point out to the
young the greater light and knowledge which the Christian enjoys,
and the plays of Terence may be read without moral danger.
No amount of colouring and caution would be sufficient to shield
the mind of an ingenuous youth from the imminent peril of being
corrupted by those of Wycherly and Congreve. Pictures of
Roman manners must represent them as corrupt, or they would
not be truthful; but often a good lesson is elicited from them.
When the deceived wife reproachfully asks her offending husband
with what face he can rebuke his son because he has a mistress
when he himself has two wives,<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c012'><sup>[205]</sup></a> one is far more struck with the
honour which the strictness of Roman virtue paid to the nuptial
tie, than offended at the lenient view which is taken of the young
man’s fault. The knaveries and tricks of Davus<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c012'><sup>[206]</sup></a> meet with sufficient
poetical justice in his fright and his flogging. The very
dress in which the Meretrix, or woman of abandoned morals, was
costumed, kept constantly before the eyes of the Roman youth
their grasping avarice, and therefore warned them of the ruin
which awaited their victims; and the well-known passage,<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c012'><sup>[207]</sup></a> in
which the loathsome habits of this class are described, must
have been, as Terence himself says, a preservative of youthful
virtue:—</p>

<p class='c022'>The Pander, who basely, for the sake of filthy lucre, ministers
to the passions of the young, is represented as the most degraded
and contemptible of mortals. The Parasite, who earns his meal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>by flattering and fawning on his rich patron, is made the butt
of unsparing ridicule. And the timid, simple maiden, confiding
too implicitly in the affections of her lover, and sacrificing her
interests to that love, and not to lust or love of gain, is painted
in such colours as to command the spectator’s pity and sympathy,
and to call forth his approbation when she is deservedly reinstated
in her position as an honourable matron. Lastly, her
lover is not represented as a profligate, revelling in the indiscriminate
indulgence of his passions, and rendering vice seductive
by engaging manners and fascinating qualities: but we feel
that his sin necessarily results from the absence of a high tone
of public morality to protect the young against temptation; and
in all cases the reality and permanency of his affection for the
victim of his wrongdoing is proved by his readiness and anxiety
to become her husband.</p>

<p class='c011'>So far as it can be so, comedy was in the hands of Terence an
instrument of moral teaching, for it can only be so indirectly
by painting men and manners as they are, and not as they ought
to be.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is said that the patrons of Terence assisted him in the composition
of his comedies, or, at least, corrected their language
and style, and embellished them by the insertion of scenes and
passages. An anecdote is related by Cornelius Nepos,<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c012'><sup>[208]</sup></a> which,
if true, at once proves the point. He says that Lælius was at his
villa near Puteoli during the festival of the Matronalia. On this
holiday the power of the Roman ladies was absolute. Lælius
was ordered by his wife to come to supper early. He excused
himself on the ground that he was occupied, and begged not to
be disturbed. When he appeared in the supper-room, he said
he had never been so well satisfied with his compositions. He
was asked for a specimen of what he had written, and immediately
repeated a scene in the “<cite class='quote'>Self-Tormentor</cite>”<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c012'><sup>[209]</sup></a> of Terence.
Terence, however, gently refutes this story in the prologue to
the “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Adelphi</span></cite>,” and gives it a positive contradiction in the prologue
to the comedy in which the passage occurs. Perhaps he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>may at first have permitted the report to be credited for the
sake of paying a compliment to his patron.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a tradition that he lived and died in poverty, and
this tale is perpetuated in the following lines by Porcius Licinius:——</p>

<p class='c011'>The patrons of Terence, however, never deserved the reproach
of meanness. Nor could the comic poet have been very poor.

to reside for some time in Greece; and at his death he possessed
gardens on the Appian Way twenty jugera in extent.</p>

he was, as Volcatius writes, never seen more:——</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>“<cite>The Andrian.</cite>”</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>“<cite class='quote'>The Andrian</cite>” was exhibited at the Magalensian games, <span class='fss'>A.
U. C.</span> 588,<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c012'><sup>[211]</sup></a> when the poet was in his twenty-seventh year. The
musical accompaniment was performed on equal flutes, right-handed
and left-handed (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tibiis paribus dextris et sinistris</span></i>;) <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>,
as the action was of a serio-comic character, the lively music
of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tibiæ dextræ</span></i> was used in the comic scenes; the solemn
sounds of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">tibiæ sinistræ</span></i> accompanied the serious portion.
The manners are Greek, and the scene is laid at Athens.</p>

<p class='c011'>The plot is as follows:—Glycerium, a young Athenian girl, is
placed under the care of an Andrian, who educates her with his
daughter Chrysis. On his death Chrysis migrates to Athens,
taking Glycerium with her as her sister, and is driven by distress
to become a courtesan. Pamphilus, the son of Simo, falls
in love with Glycerium, and promises her marriage. Simo accidentally
discovers his son’s attachment in the following manner:—Chrysis
dies, and at her funeral Glycerium imprudently
approaches too near to the burning pile. Her lover rushes
forward and embraces her, and affectionately expostulates with
her for thus risking her life. “Dearest Glycerium!” he exclaims,
“what are you doing? Why do you rush to destruction?”
Upon this the girl burst into a flood of tears, and
threw herself into his arms. Simo had meanwhile betrothed
Pamphilus to Philumena, the daughter of Chremes; and although
he had discovered his son’s passion, and Chremes had
heard of the promise of marriage, he pretends that the marriage
with Philumena shall still take place, in order that he
may discover what his son’s real sentiments are. In this difficulty,
Pamphilus applies to Davus, a cunning and clever slave,
who advises him to offer no opposition. At this crisis Glycerium
is delivered of a child, which Davus causes to be laid at
the door of Simo. Chremes sees the infant, and, understanding
that Pamphilus is the father, refuses to give him his daughter.
The opportune arrival of Crito, an Andrian, discovers to
Chremes that Glycerium is his own daughter, whom on a former
absence from Athens he had intrusted to his brother Phania,
now dead. Consequently Glycerium is married to Pamphilus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>and Philumena is given to a young lover, named Charinus, who
had hitherto pressed his suit in vain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<cite class='quote'>The Andrian</cite>” was, as it deserved to be, eminently successful,
and encouraged the young author to persevere in the
career which he had chosen. The interest is well sustained,
the action is natural, and many scenes touching and pathetic,
whilst the serious parts are skilfully relieved by the adroitness
of Davus, and his cleverness in getting out of the scrapes in
which his cunning involves him. Cicero<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c012'><sup>[212]</sup></a> praises the funeral
scene<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c012'><sup>[213]</sup></a> as an example of that talent for narrative which Terence
constantly displays. The substance of his criticism is, that the
poet has attained conciseness without the sacrifice of beauty;
and whilst he has avoided wearisome affectation, has not omitted
any details which are agreeable and interesting. Nothing
can be more beautiful than the struggle between the love and
filial duty of Pamphilus,<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c012'><sup>[214]</sup></a> which ends with his determination to
yield to his father’s will; nothing more candid than his confession,
or more upright than his earnest desire not to be suspected
of suborning Crito.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<cite class='quote'>The Andrian</cite>” has been closely imitated in the comedy of
“<cite class='quote'>The Conscious Lovers</cite>,” by Sir Richard Steele; but in natural
and graceful wit, as well as ingenuity, the English play is far
inferior to the Roman original.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>“<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eunuchus.</span></cite>”</h4>

<p class='c018'>“<cite class='quote'>The Eunuch</cite>” is a transcript of a comedy by Menander.
Even the characters are the same, except that Gnatho and Thraso
together occupy the place of Colax (the flatterer) in the original
Greek. It was represented in the consulship of M. Valerius
Messala and C. Fannius Strabo.<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c012'><sup>[215]</sup></a> The musical accompaniment
was Lydian. It was the most popular of all Terence’s plays,
and brought the author the largest sum of money that had ever
been paid for a comedy previously, namely, 8,000 sestertii, a
sum equivalent to about 65<i>l.</i> sterling. In vain Lavinius, Terence’s
most bitter rival, endeavoured to interrupt the performance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>and to accuse the author of plagiarism. His defence was
perfectly successful, and Suetonius states<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c012'><sup>[216]</sup></a> that it was called for
twice in one day.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<cite class='quote'>The Eunuch</cite>” is not equal to some of Terence’s plays in wit
and humour; but the plot is bustling and animated, and the
dialogue gay and sparkling: it is also unquestionably the best
acting play of the whole. There is no play in which there is a
greater individuality of character, or more effect of histrionic
contrast. The lovesick and somewhat effeminate Phædria contrasts
well with the ardent and passionate Chærea, the swaggering,
bullying Thraso with the pompous, philosophical parasite,
who proposes to found a Gnathonic School. Parmeno is quite
as crafty, but far more clever, than Davus, and his description
of the evils of love is the perfection of shrewd wisdom.</p>

<p class='c011'>The plot is as follows:—Pamphila, the daughter of an Athenian
citizen, was kidnapped in her infancy, and sold to a Rhodian.
He gave her to a courtesan, who educated her with her own
daughter Thais. Subsequently Thais removes to Athens; and
on the mother’s death Pamphila is sold to a soldier, named
Thraso. The soldier, being in love with Thais, resolves to make
her a present of his purchase; but Thais has got another lover,
Phædria, and Thraso refuses to give Pamphila to Thais unless
Phædria is first turned off. She, thinking that she has discovered
Pamphila’s relations, and anxious to restore her to them, persuades
Phædria to absent himself for two days, in order that
Thraso may present her with the maiden. Meanwhile Chærea,
Phædria’s younger brother, sees Pamphila accidentally, and falls
desperately in love with her. He, therefore, persuades his brother’s
slave, Parmeno, to introduce him into Thais’ house in the
disguise of a eunuch, whom Phædria has intrusted him to convey
to her during his absence. This leads to an <i>éclaircissement</i>.
Pamphila is discovered to be an Athenian citizen, and her brother
Chremes gives her in marriage to Chærea.</p>

<p class='c011'>The most skilful part of this play is the method by which
Terence has connected the underplot between Parmeno and
Pythias, the waiting-maid of Thais, with the main action, their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>quarrels being entirely instrumental in bringing about the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement</span></i>.
Of all the comedies of Terence, the moral tone of
this is the lowest and most degrading. The connivance of Laches
the father of Chærea, at his son’s illicit amour with Thais, presents
a sad picture of moral corruption, as the arrangement coolly
made between Phædria and Gnatho<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c012'><sup>[217]</sup></a> displays the meanness, which
evidently was not considered inconsistent with the habits of
Roman society.</p>

<p class='c011'>Grievous as are these blemishes, this comedy must always be
a favourite. There are in it passages of which the lapse of ages
has not diminished the pungency: take, for example, the quiet
satire contained in the contrast which Chærea draws between
the healthful and natural beauty of his mistress and the “every-day
forms of which his eyes are weary:”—</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>could raise a laugh. It is a good specimen of the refined taste
of Terence, who, unlike Plautus, abhorred vulgarity and ribaldry,
and did not often condescend even to humour. Its favourable
reception, moreover, proves that, notwithstanding the preference
which the Roman people were inclined to give to gladiatorial
shows, and the more innocent amusements of buffoons and rope-dancers,
and the noisy mirth with which theatrical entertainments
were frequently interrupted, they could appreciate and
enjoy a skilfully-constructed plot, and that quality which Terence

<p class='c011'>Clinia returns from Asia, and takes up his abode at the house
of his friend Clitipho, the son of Chremes. This Clitipho has
fallen in love with Bacchis, an extravagant courtesan; and
Syrus, an artful slave, persuades him to pass off Bacchis as the
object of Clinia’s affection, and Antiphila as her waiting-maid.
Chremes, next day, to whom Menedemus had communicated his
grief and remorse, acquaints him with the return of his son, and
recommends him to pretend ignorance of his amour. By the
intrigues and knavery of Syrus, Chremes is induced to pay 10
minæ (40<i>l.</i>) to Clitipho for the support of Bacchis. Sostrata,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>the wife of Chremes, has mean while discovered, by a ring in
her possession, that Antiphila is her daughter. She had, according
to the cruel Athenian practice, given her to the Corinthian in
infancy that she might not be exposed; she had given the ring,
the means of her discovery, at the same time. Clinia, therefore,
marries Antiphila; and Chremes, although enraged at the imposition
of Syrus, forgives him and his son, and Clitipho promises
that he will give up Bacchis and marry a neighbour’s daughter.</p>

<p class='c011'>This play abounds in amiable and generous sentiments and
passages of simple and graphic beauty. The whole scene, in
which the habits of the poor girl whom Clinia loves is described,
is exquisitely true to nature. Her occupation is like that of
the chaste Lucretia in the legend:—</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Plot.</i>——Chremes, an Athenian, although he has a wife at Athens,
(Nausistrata,) marries another at Lemnos under the feigned name

Demipho, that she shall become the wife of his son Antipho.
After this, the two old men leave Athens; and in their absence
Demipho’s son, Phædria, falls in love with a minstrel-girl, and
the Lemnian wife arrives at Athens, together with her daughter
Phanium. There she dies; and Antipho, seeing Phanium at the
funeral, becomes enamoured of her. Not knowing what to do,
he takes the advice of Phormio. In the case of a destitute
orphan, the Athenian law compelled the nearest of kin to marry
her or to give a portion. Phormio brings an action against
Antipho; the case is proved, and he marries Phanium. The old
men return, and Chremes, not knowing that Phanium is his own
daughter, is desperately angry. Mean while, Dorio, the owner
of Pamphila, threatens to sell her to some one else unless Phædria
will immediately pay him thirty minæ. Geta, a knavish
servant of Demipho, procures this money by telling the old gentleman
that Phormio is willing to take Antipho’s wife off his
hands on condition of receiving thirty minæ. Phanium is eventually
discovered and acknowledged, and thus matters are happily
concluded. Nausistrata is at first very angry, but relents on the
submission of the repentant Chremes.</p>

<p class='c011'>This comedy supplied Molière with a large portion of the
materials for “<cite class='quote'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Fourberies de Scapin</span></cite>.”</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Hecyra.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>This comedy, which, if the inscription may be trusted, is a
translation or adaptation from one by Menander, was the least
successful of all the plays of Terence. Twice it was rejected;
on the first occasion, as the prologue to its second representation
informs us, owing to “an unheard-of calamity and impediment.”<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c012'><sup>[224]</sup></a>
The thoughts of the public were so occupied by a rope-dancer
that they would not hear a word. Terence feared to risk a second
representation on the same day; but such confidence had he in
the merits of the play, that he offered it a second time for sale
to the ædiles, and it was acted again in the consulship of Cn.
Octavius and T. Manlius.<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c012'><sup>[225]</sup></a> It was acted a third time at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>funeral games of L. Æmilius Paulus, when it was again rejected.
On its next representation, it was successful; and Ambivius Turpio,
by whose theatrical company it was performed, and whose
popularity had already caused the revival of some unsuccessful
plays,<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c012'><sup>[226]</sup></a> undertook to plead its cause in a new prologue. This
prologue enters fully into the circumstances which caused its
rejection. It states that some renowned boxers and expected
performances of a rope-dancer caused a great tumult and disturbance,
especially among the female part of the audience; that,
at the next representation, the first act went off with applause,
but a rumour spread of a gladiatorial combat, the people flocked
to a show which was more congenial to their taste, and the theatre
was deserted. In conclusion, for the sake of the art of
poetry, for the encouragement of himself to buy new plays, and
for the protection of the poet from malicious critics, Ambivio
entreated the patient attention of the audience; and the appeal
of the old favourite servant of the public was successful.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Hecyra is, without doubt, inferior to the other plays of
Terence, and probably for that reason has never been imitated
in modern literature. It is a drama of domestic life, and yet
the plot is deficient in interest, and the scenes want life and
variety.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Plot.</i>—Pamphilus, at the desire of his father, Laches, marries
Philumena, the daughter of Phidippus and Myrrhina, but being
involved in an amour with Bacchis, has no affection for his wife,
and avoids all intercourse with her. Meanwhile, Bacchis offended
at his marriage, shows such an ill-temper, that his affection is
weaned from her and transferred to Philumena. Pamphilus
then goes to Imbrus, and on his return is surprised with the
news that Philumena has left his father’s house, and subsequently
discovers that she has given birth to a son. He refuses, consequently,
to receive her as his wife; but as he loves her to distraction,
he promises her mother that he will keep her shame
secret. As he will neither live with his wife nor assign any
reason, Bacchis is suspected of being the cause. But she clears
herself from the suspicion. Myrrhina, however, recognises upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>her finger a ring belonging to her daughter. This leads to the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement</span></i>. Pamphilus had one night when intoxicated met
Philumena, and offered her violence. He had forced a ring
from her finger and given it to Bacchis. He, therefore, with
joy, acknowledges the child as his own, and restores his injured
wife to his affections.</p>

<p class='c011'>The comedy derives its title, Hecyra (the mother-in-law,) from
the part taken by Sostrata, the mother of Pamphilus. Laches,
unable to account for the conduct of Philumena and his son, is
firmly persuaded that his wife Sostrata had taken a prejudice
against her daughter-in-law, and Pamphilus, notwithstanding his
dutiful affection for his mother, cannot avoid being under a similar
impression. Sostrata, in order to remove this suspicion, offers
with noble generosity to leave the house in order that Philumena
may return.</p>

<p class='c011'>This amiable rivalry of maternal devotion on the one hand,
and filial respect on the other, constitutes the most interesting
portion of the comedy; and Terence has thus endeavoured to
rescue the relation of mother-in-law from the prejudice which,
too often deservedly, attached to it.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Adelphi.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>This comedy was acted at the funeral games of L. Æmilius
Paulus Macedonius, the conqueror of Perseus, in the consulship
of L. Anicius Gallus and M. Cornelius Cethegus.<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c012'><sup>[227]</sup></a> The music
was Sarrane or Tyrian, the grave character of which was suitable
to the solemnity of the occasion. The cost of the representation
was borne by Q. Fabius Maximus, and P. C. Scipio Africanus,
the sons of the deceased.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Plot.</i>—Demea, a country gentleman and a strict disciplinarian,
has two sons, Æschinus and Ctesipho. Æschinus, the elder, is
adopted by his uncle Micio, a bachelor of indulgent temper and
somewhat loose principles, who lives a town life at Athens.
Whilst Ctesipho is brought up strictly in the country, Æschinus
is educated with too great indulgence, and pursues a course of
riot and extravagance. One night, in a moment of drunken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>passion, he offers violence to Pamphila, a young maiden, well
born but poor; for which outrage he makes amends by a promise
of marriage. Ctesipho soon after falls in love with a minstrel
girl whom he accidentally meets; and Æschinus, to save his
brother from his father’s anger, conceals his amour and takes
the discredit of it upon himself. At last he assaults the pander
to whom the girl belongs, takes her away by force, and gives
her to his brother. The affair comes to Demea’s ears, who severely
reproves Micio for ruining his son by injudicious indulgence.
Matters are at length explained, and the marriage between
Æschinus and Pamphila takes place, the minstrel girl is
assigned to Ctesipho, and the price for her paid. The old bachelor,
Micio, marries Sostrata, the mother of Pamphila, and, according
to the usual rule of comedy, all the inferior persons of the drama
are made happy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lax as the morals are which Micio refrains from correcting,
his conduct illustrates a valuable principle in education; that——</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Nor are the evils likely to arise from indifference to moral
principle left entirely without an antidote. A wise and not indiscriminate
indulgence is upheld by Demea; and, at the conclusion
of the play, he announces his deliberate change of character,
but, at the same time, points out the pernicious errors of
that kindness and indulgence which proceeds from impulse and
not from principle.</p>

<p class='c011'>This twofold lesson is by no means a useless one to parents, not
to purchase the affection of their children by injudicious indulgence
like Micio, nor, on the other hand, like Demea, to strain the
cord too tight, and thus tempt their children to pursue a course
of deceit, and to refuse their confidence to their natural advisers
and guardians. The most beautiful feature, however, of
the play is the picture which it gives of fraternal affection.
This was the last comedy of the author. It furnished Molière
with the idea of his “<cite class='quote'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ecole des Maris</span></cite>,” and Baron with great
part of the plot of “<cite class='quote'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Ecole de Pères</span></cite>.” Shadwell was also indebted
to it for his “<cite class='quote'>Squire of Alsatia</cite>,” and Garrick for his
comedy of “<cite class='quote'>The Guardian</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The following comparison of the two great Roman comic
poets by a French critic is a just one:——</p>

<p class='c011'>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce poète (Térence) a beaucoup plus d’art, mais il me semble
que l’autre a plus d’esprit. Terence fait beaucoup plus parler
qu’agir; l’autre fait plus agir que parler: et c’est le véritable
caractère de la comédie, qui est beaucoup plus dans l’action que
dans le discours. Cette vivacité me paroît donner encore un
grand avantage à Plaute; c’est que ses intrigues sont bien variées,
et ont toujours quelque chose qui surprend agréablement;
au lieu que le théâtre semble languir quelquefois dans Térence,
à qui la vivacité de l’action et les nœuds des incidens et des intrigues
manquent manifestement.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011'>If Terence was inferior to Plautus in life and bustle and intrigue,
and in the powerful delineation of national character,
he is superior in elegance of language and refinement of taste;
he far more rarely offends against decency, and he substitutes
delicacy of sentiment for vulgarity. The justness of his reflections
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>more than compensates for the absence of his predecessor’s
humour: he touches the heart as well as gratifies the intellect.</p>

<p class='c011'>If he was deficient in <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis comica</span></i>, it is only the defect which
Cæsar attributed to Roman comedy generally; and Cicero, who
thought that Roman wit was even more piquant than Attic salt
itself, paid him a merited compliment in the following line:——</p>

<div class='c016'>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Quicquid come loquens atque omnia dulcia dicens.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>It has been objected to Terence that he superabounds in soliloquies;<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c012'><sup>[228]</sup></a>
but it is not surprising that he should have delighted
in them, since no author ever surpassed him in narrative. His
natural and unaffected simplicity renders him the best possible
teller of a story: he never indulges in a display of forced wit
or in attempts at epigrammatic sharpness; there are no superfluous
touches, although his pictures are enlivened by sufficient
minuteness; his moral lessons are conveyed in familiar proverb-like
suggestions, not in dull and pedantic dogmatism.</p>

<p class='c011'>The remaining comic poets will require but brief notice. L.
Afranius was a contemporary of Terence, and flourished about
<span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 150. His comedies were all of the lowest class of <i>fabulæ
togatæ</i> (tabernariæ;) and he was generally allowed by the critics
to possess great skill in accommodating the Greek comedy to
the representation of Roman manners:——</p>

<p class='c011'>His style was short and eloquent (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">perargutus et disertus</span></i>,)<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c012'><sup>[229]</sup></a> but
he was a man of low tastes and profligate morals;<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c012'><sup>[230]</sup></a> and, therefore,
although, from living amidst the scenes of vulgar vice which he
delighted to paint, his characters were true to nature, they were
revolting and disgusting. His immorality, probably, as much
as his talent, caused him to continue a favourite under the most
corrupt times of the empire. Fragments and titles of many of
his comedies have been preserved.</p>

<p class='c011'>The name of Atilius is made known to us by Cicero, who mentions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>him three times. In a letter to Atticus,<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c012'><sup>[231]</sup></a> he calls him a
most crabbed poet (<i>poeta durissimus</i>,) and quotes the following

of a bad translation of the Electra of Sophocles, and refers to
the testimony of Licinius, who pronounces him as “hard as

<p class='c022'>and, lastly, in the “<cite class='quote'>Tusculan Disputations</cite>,”<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c012'><sup>[233]</sup></a> he gives the title of
one of his plays—<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μισογυνος</span> (the Woman-hater.) Of his birth and
private history nothing has been recorded.</p>

<p class='c011'>P. Licinius Tegula is generally supposed to have been one of
the oldest of the Latin comic writers, having flourished as early
as the beginning of the second century <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> The few fragments
which remain of his works afford no opportunity of determining
how far he deserved the place assigned to him in the epigram
of Volcatius.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lavinius Luscius is severely criticised by Terence in his prologues
to the Eunuchus, Heautontimorumenos, and Phormio, although
he is not mentioned by name. Terence, however, defends
the severity of his strictures, on the ground that Luscius
was the first aggressor. In the first of the above-mentioned
prologues, we are informed that he translated well; but, by unskilful
alterations and adaptations of the plots, made bad Latin
comedies out of good Greek ones:—</p>

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Two plays of Menander are mentioned as having been
thus ill-treated—the Phasma (Phantom,) and the Thesaurus
(Treasure.) How he spoilt the plot of the former is not
stated; but in the version of the Thesaurus, Terence convicts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Luscius of a legal blunder. A young prodigal has sold his inheritance,
on which his father’s tomb stands, to an old miser.
The father, foreseeing the consequence of his son’s extravagance,
had, before his death, bid him open the tomb after the expiration
of ten years. He does so, and finds a treasure. The old
man claims the treasure as his own, and the young man brings
an action to recover it. The mistake of which Luscius was
guilty, was, that in the conduct of the cause he made the defendant
open the pleadings instead of the plaintiff.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the works of Q. Trabea no fragments remain except the
short passages quoted by Cicero,<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c012'><sup>[234]</sup></a> and the time at which he
flourished is unknown. There is an anecdote which relates that
Muretus presented to Jos. Scaliger a translation in Latin verse
from a poem of Philemon, preserved by Stobæus, which he pretended
was by Trabea. Scaliger was imposed upon; and in his
notes on Varro, quoted the verses of Muretus as the work of
Trabea. When he discovered the trick, he suppressed them in
the Latin editions of his notes, and revenged himself on Muretus
by a libellous epigram.<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c012'><sup>[235]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The last of these dramatic writers who remains to be mentioned
is Sextus Turpilius. A few fragments, as well as the titles
of some of his plays, are still extant. All the titles are Greek,
and, therefore, probably his comedies were <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fabulæ Palliatæ</span></i>. He
flourished during the second century <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span>, and died, according
to the Eusebian Chronicle, at the commencement of the first
century.<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c012'><sup>[236]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>From what has been already said, it is sufficiently clear that
the Italians, like all other Indo-European races, had some taste
for the drama, but that this taste developed itself in a love for
scenes of humorous satire. Whilst, therefore, Roman comedy
originated in Italy, and was brought to perfection by the influence
of Greek literature, Roman tragedy,<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c012'><sup>[237]</sup></a> on the other hand,
was transplanted from Athens, and with the exception of a very
few cases, was never anything more than translation or imitation.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the century, during which, together with comedy, it flourished
and decayed, it boasted of five distinguished writers—Livius,
Nævius, Ennius, Pacuvius, and Attius. The only claim
of Atilius to be considered as a tragic poet is his having been
the translator of one Greek tragedy. But, in after ages, Rome
did not produce one tragic poet unless Varius can be considered
an exception. His tragedy, <cite>Thyestes</cite>, which enjoyed so
high a reputation amongst the critics of the Augustan age, that
Quintilian, whose judgment generally agrees with them, pronounces
it as able to bear comparison with the productions of
the Greek tragic poets. It was acted on one occasion, namely,
after the return of Octavius from the battle of Actium, and the
poet received for it 1,000,000 sesterces (about 8,000<i>l.</i>)<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c012'><sup>[238]</sup></a> The
tragedies attributed to Seneca were never acted, and were only
composed for reading and recitation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some account has already been given of Livius, Nævius, and
Ennius, because their poetical reputation rests rather on other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>grounds than on their talents for dramatic poetry. But, before
proceeding with the lives and writings of Pacuvius and Attius,
it will be necessary to examine the causes which prevented
tragedy from flourishing at Rome.</p>

<p class='c011'>In endeavouring to account for this phenomenon, it is not
sufficient to say, that in the national legends of the Hellenic
race were imbodied subjects essentially of a dramatic character,
and that epic poetry contained incidents, characters, sentiments,
and even dramatic machinery, which only required to be put
upon the stage. Doubtless the Greek epics and legends were
an inexhaustible source of inspiration to the tragic poets. But
it is also true that the Romans had national legends which formed
the groundwork of their history, and were interwoven in their
early literature. These legends, however, were private, not
public property; they were preserved in the records and pedigrees
of private families, and ministered to their glory, and
were therefore more interesting to the members of these houses
than to the people at large: they were not preserved as a national
treasure by priestly families, like those of the Attic Eumolpidæ,
nor did they twine themselves around the hearts of
the Roman people, as the venerable traditions of Greece did
around those of that nation. The Romans did not live in them—they
were embalmed in their poets as curious records of antiquity
or acknowledged fictions—they did not furnish occasions
for awakening national enthusiasm. Although, therefore, they
existed, they were comparatively powerless over the popular
mind as elements of dramatic effect.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were jealously preserved by illustrious houses, furnished
materials in a dry and unadorned form to the annalists, and
were embellished by the graphic power of the historian; but it
is not probable that they ever constituted, in the same sense as
the Greek legends, the folklore of the Roman people. In themselves,
the lays of Horatius and of the lake Regillus were sufficiently
stirring, and those of Lucretia, Coriolanus, and Virginia
sufficiently moving, for tragedy, but they were not familiar to
the masses of the people.</p>

<p class='c011'>A period at length arrived in which there was a still further
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>reason why Roman national legends, however adapted for tragedy
they might be abstractedly, had not power to move the
affections of the Roman populace. It ceased to have a personal
interest in them. The masses had undergone a complete change.
The Roman people of the most flourishing literary eras were
not the descendants of those who maintained the national glory
in the legendary period. Not only were almost all the patrician
families then extinct, but war and poverty had extinguished the
middle classes, and miserably thinned the lower orders. The
old veterans of pure Roman blood who survived were settled at
a distance from Rome in the different military colonies. Into
the vacancy thus caused had poured thousands of slaves, captives
in the bloody wars of Gaul and Spain, and Greece and Africa.
These and their descendants replaced the ancient people. Many
of them received liberty and franchise, and some by their talents
and energy arrived at wealth and station. But they could not
possibly be Romans at heart, or consider the past glories of their
adopted country as their own. They were bound by no ties of
old associations to it. The ancient legends had no especial
interest in their eyes. It mattered little whether the incidents
and characters of the tragedy which they witnessed were Greek
or Roman. It was to the rise of this new element of population,
and the displacement or absorption of the old race, that the
decline of patriotism was owing—the careless disregard of
everything except daily sustenance and daily amusement,<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c012'><sup>[239]</sup></a> which
paved the way for the empire, and marked the downfall of liberty.
From this cause, also, resulted in some degree the non-influential
position which national traditions occupied at Rome; and tragedy,
though for a time popular, could not maintain its popularity.
Thus it entirely disappeared; and, when it revived, it came forth,
not as the favourite of the people, but under the patronage of
select circles, and took its place, not like Athenian tragedy, as
the leading literature of the age, but simply as one species of
literary composition.</p>

<p class='c011'>A people made up of these elements held out no temptation
to the poet to leave the beaten track of his predecessor, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>imitations of Greek tragedy. They were step-sons of Rome, as
Scipio Æmilianus called the mob, who clamoured at his saying
that the death of Tiberius Gracchus was just:—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>

      <div class='line in44'><cite>Petron.</cite> v. 164.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The poet’s real patrons had been educated on Greek principles;
and hence Greek taste was completely triumphant over
national legend, and the heroes of Roman tragedy were those
who were celebrated in Hellenic story. The Roman historical
plays, (prætextatæ,) which approached most nearly towards realizing
the idea of a national tragedy, were graceful compliments
to distinguished individuals. They were usually performed at
public funerals; and as, in the procession, masks representing
the features of the deceased were borne by persons of similar
stature, so incidents in his life formed the subject of the drama
which was exhibited on the occasion.</p>

<p class='c011'>The list of <i>Fabulæ Prætextatæ</i>, even if it were perfect, would
occupy but narrow limits; nor had they sufficient merits to stand
the test of time. They survive but in name, and the titles extant
are but nine in number:——</p>

<p class='c011'>The Paulus of Pacuvius, which represented an incident in the
life of L. Æmilius Paulus.<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c012'><sup>[240]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Iter ad Lentulum, a passage in the life of Balbus.<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c012'><sup>[242]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Vescio, by the Satirist (?) Persius.</p>

<p class='c011'>Octavian, by Seneca, in the reign of Trajan.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nor must it be forgotten, in comparing the influence which
tragedy exercised upon the people of Athens and Rome, that
with the former it was a part and parcel of the national religion.
By it not only were the people taught to sympathize with their
heroic ancestors, but their sympathies were hallowed. In Greece,
the poet was held to be inspired—poetry was the voice of deified
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>nature—the tongue in which the natural held communion with
the supernatural, the visible with the invisible. With the
Romans, poetry was nothing more than an amusement of the
fancy; with the Greeks, it was a divinely originating emotion of
the soul.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hence, in Athens, the drama was, as it were, an act of worship,—it
formed an integral part of a joyous, yet serious, religious
festival. The theatre was a temple; the altar of a deity was
its central point; and a band of choristers moved in solemn
march and song in honour of the god, and, in the didactic spirit
which sanctified their office, taught men lessons of virtue. Not
that the audience entered the precincts with their hearts imbued
with holy feelings, or with the thoughts of worshippers; but
this is always the case when religious ceremonials become sensuous.
The real object of the worship is by the majority forgotten.
But still the Greeks were habituated unconsciously to
be affected by the drama, as by a development of religious sentiments.
With the Romans, the theatre was merely a place of
secular amusement. The thymele existed no longer as a memorial
of the sacrifice to the god. The orchestra, formerly consecrated
to the chorus, was to them nothing more than stalls occupied
by the dignitaries of the state. Dramas were certainly
exhibited at the great Megalensian games, but they were only
accessories to the religious character of the festival. A holy
season implies rest and relaxation—a <i>holiday</i> in the popular
sense of the word—and theatrical representations were considered
a fit and proper species of pastime; but as religion itself
did not exercise the same influence over the popular mind of the
Romans which it did over that of the Greeks, so neither with
the Romans did the drama stand in the place of the handmaid
of religion.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, their religion, though purer and chaster, was not ideal
like that of the Greeks. Its freedom from human passions removed
it out of the sphere of poetry, and, therefore, it was
neither calculated to move terror nor pity. The moral attributes
of the Deity were displayed in stern severity; but neither the
belief nor the ceremonial sought to inflame the heart of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>worshipper with enthusiasm. Rome had no priestly caste uniting
in one and the same person the character of the bard and of the
minister of religion. In after ages, she learned from the Greeks
to call the poet sacred, but the holiness which she attributed to
his character was not the earnest belief of the heart. The Roman
priests were civil magistrates; religion, therefore, became
a part of the civil administration, and a political engine. It
mattered little what was believed as true. The old national
faith of Italy, not being firmly rooted in the heart, soon became
obsolete: it readily admitted the engrafting of foreign superstitions.
The old deities assumed the names of the Greek
mythology: they exchanged their attributes and histories for
those of Greek legend, and a host of strange gods filled their
Pantheon. They had, however, no hold either on the belief
or the love of the people: they were mythological and unreal
characters, fit only to furnish subjects and embellishments for
poetry.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nor was the genius of the Roman people such as to sympathize
with the legends of the past. The Romans lived in the present
and the future, rather than in the past. The poet might call
the age in which he lived degenerate, and look forward with
mournful anticipations to a still lower degradation, whilst he
looked back admiringly to bygone times. Through the vista of
past years, Roman virtue and greatness seemed to his imagination
magnified: he could lament, as Horace did, a gradual decay, which
had not as yet reached its worst point:——</p>

<div class='c016'>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ætas parentum pejor avis tulit</div>

      <div class='line in43'><cite>Od.</cite> III. vi. 46.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c022'>But the people did not sympathize with these feelings: they
delighted in action, not in contemplation and reflection. They
did not look back upon their national heroes as demigods, or
dream over their glories: they were pressing forward and extending
the frontiers of their empire, bringing under their yoke
tribes and nations which their forefathers had not known. If
they regarded their ancestors at all, it was not in the light of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>men of heroic stature, as compared with themselves, but as those
whom they could equal or even surpass: they lived in hope and
not in memory.</p>

<p class='c011'>These are not the elements of character which would lead a
people to realize to themselves the ideal of tragedy. The tragic
poet at Athens would have been sure that the same subject which
inspired him would also interest his audience—that if his genius
rose to the height which their critical taste demanded, he could
reckon up the sympathy of a theatre crowded with ten thousand
of his countrymen. A Roman tragic poet would have been deserted
for any spectacle of a more stirring nature—his most
affecting scenes and noble sentiments, for scenes of real action
and real life. The bloody combats of the gladiators, the miserable
captives and malefactors stretched on crosses, expiring in
excruciating agonies, or mangled by wild beasts, were real tragedies—the
sham fights and Naumachiæ, though only imitations,
were real dramas, in which those pursuits which most deeply
interested the spectators, which constituted their chief duties
and highest glories, were visibly represented. Even gorgeous
spectacles fed their personal vanity and pride in their national
greatness. The spoil of conquered nations, borne in procession
across the stage, reminded them of their triumphs and their
victories; and the magnificent dress of the actors—the model of
the captured city, preceded and followed by its sculptures in
marble and ivory—represented in mimic grandeur the ovation
or the triumph of some successful general, whose return from a
distant expedition, laden with wealth, realized the rumours which
had already arrived at the gates of Rome; whilst the scene,
glittering with glass, and gold, and silver, and adorned with
variegated pillars of foreign marble, told ostentatiously of their
wealth and splendour.<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c012'><sup>[243]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Again, the Romans were a rough, turbulent people, full of
physical rather than intellectual energy, loving antagonism,
courting peril, setting no value on human life or suffering.
Their very virtues were stern and severe. The unrelenting
justice of a Brutus, representing as it did the victory of principle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>over feeling, was to them the height of virtue. They were ready
to undergo the extreme of physical torture with Regulus, and to
devote themselves to death, like Curtius and the Decii. Hard
and pitiless to themselves, they were, as might be expected, the
same towards others. They were, in fact, strangers to both the
passions, which it was the object of tragedy to excite and to
purify, Pity and Terror.<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c012'><sup>[244]</sup></a> They were too stern to pity, too unimaginative
to be moved by the tales of wonder and deeds of
horror which affected the tender and marvel-loving imagination
of the Greeks. Being an active, and not a sentimental people,
they did not appreciate moral suffering and the struggles of a
sensitive spirit. They were moved only by scenes of physical
suffering and agony.</p>

<p class='c011'>The public games of Greece at Olympia, or the Isthmus, were
bloodless and peaceful, and the refinements of poetry mingled
with those which were calculated to invigorate the physical
powers and develop manly beauty. Those of Rome were exhibitions,
not of moral, but of physical courage and endurance:
they were sanguinary and brutalizing,—the amusements of a
nation to whom war was not a necessary evil or a struggle for
national existence, for hearths and altars, but a pleasure and a
pastime—the means of gratifying an aggressive ambition. The
tragic feeling of Greece is represented by the sculptured grief
of Niobe, that of Rome by the death-struggles which distort the
features and muscles of the Laocoon. It was, if the expression
is allowable, <i>amphitheatrical</i>, not <i>theatrical</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>To such a people the moral woes of tragedy were powerless;
and yet it is to the people that the drama, if it is to flourish,
must look for patronage. A refined and educated society, such
as always existed at Rome during its literary period, might
applaud a happy adaptation from the Greek tragedians, and encourage
a poet in his task—for it is only an educated and refined
taste which can appreciate such talent as skilful imitation displays;
but a tragic drama under such circumstances could hardly
hope to be national. Nor must it be forgotten, with reference
to their taste for spectacle, that the artistic accessories of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>drama would have a better chance of success with a people like
the Romans than literary merit, because the pleasures of art are
of a lower and more sensuous kind. Hence, in the popular eye,
the decoration of the theatre and the costume of the performers
naturally became the principal requisites, whilst the poet’s office
was considered subordinate to the manner in which the play was
put upon the stage; and thus the degenerate theatrical taste
which prevailed in the days of Horace called forth the poet’s
well-known and well-deserved criticism.<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c012'><sup>[245]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>It cannot, indeed, be asserted that tragedy was never, to a
certain extent, an acceptable entertainment at Rome, but only
that it never flourished at Rome as it did at Athens—that no
Roman tragedies can, notwithstanding all that has been said in
their praise and their defence, be compared with those of Greece,
and that the tragic drama never maintained such a hold on the
popular mind as not to be liable to be displaced by amusements
of a more material and less intellectual kind. It was imitative
and destitute of originality. It was introduced from without as
one portion of the new literature; it did not grow spontaneously
by a process of natural development out of preceding eras of
epic and lyric poetry, and start into being, as it did at Athens,
at the very moment when the public mind and taste was ready
to receive and appreciate it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Three eras, separated from one another by chasms, the second
wider than the first, produced tragic poets. In the first of these
flourished Livius Andronicus, Nævius, and Ennius; in the second
Pacuvius and Attius; in the third Asinius Pollio<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c012'><sup>[246]</sup></a> wrote tragedies,
the plots of which, as the words of Virgil seem to imply, were
taken from Roman history.<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c012'><sup>[247]</sup></a> Varius either wrote, or, as some
of the Scholiasts assert, stole, the “<cite class='quote'>Thyestes</cite>” from Cassius or
Virgil. Ovid attempted a “<cite class='quote'>Medea</cite>,” of which Quintilian speaks,
as being, to say the least, a promising performance; and even
the Emperor Augustus himself, together with other men of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>genius, tried their hands, though unsuccessfully, at tragedy.
The epistle of Horace to the Pisos shows at once the prevalence
of this taste, and that general ignorance of the rules and principles
of art required instruction. Ten rhetorical dramas, attributed
with good reason to the philosopher Seneca, complete the
catalogue of tragedies belonging to this era, but with the exception
of these, no specimens remain; most probably they did not
merit preservation. The tragedies of the older school were of
a higher stamp, and they kept their place in the public estimation
long enough to give birth to the newer and inferior school.
Passages from the old Latin tragedies quoted by Cicero well
deserve the admiration with which he regarded them; and a
fragment of the “<cite class='quote'>Prometheus</cite>” of Attius is marked by a grandeur
and sublimity which makes us regret the almost total loss
of this branch of Roman literature.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Pacuvius</span> (<span class='fss'>BORN B. C.</span> 220.)</h4>

<p class='c018'>The era at which Roman tragedy reached its highest degree
of perfection was the second of those mentioned, and was simultaneous
with that of comedy. Both nourished together; for,
whilst Terence was so successfully reproducing the wit and manners
of the new Attic comedy, M. Pacuvius was enriching the
Roman drama with free imitations of the Greek tragedians. He
was a native of Brundisium, and nephew,<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c012'><sup>[248]</sup></a> or, according to St.
Jerome, grandson of the poet Ennius. Although born as early
as <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 220, he does not appear to have attained the height of
his popularity until <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span><a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c012'><sup>[249]</sup></a> During his residence at Rome,
where he remained until after his 80th year,<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c012'><sup>[250]</sup></a> he distinguished
himself as a painter as well as a dramatic poet; and one of his
pictures in the temple of Hercules was thought only to be surpassed
by the work of Fabius Pictor.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c012'><sup>[251]</sup></a> He formed one of that
literary circle of which Lælius was so great an ornament. The
close of his long life was passed in the retirement of Tarentum,
where he died in the ninetieth year of his age. A simple and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>unpretending epigram is preserved by Aulus Gellius,<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c012'><sup>[252]</sup></a> which
may probably have been written by himself:——</p>

<div class='c016'>

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Pacuvius was a great favourite with those who could make
allowances for the faults, and appreciate the merits, of the great
writers of antiquity, and his verses were popular in the time of
J. Cæsar;<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c012'><sup>[253]</sup></a> and that lover of the old Roman literature, Cicero,
though not blind to his faults, is warm in his commendations.
He was not without admirers in the Augustan age, and even his
defects had zealous defenders in the time of Persius amongst
those who could scarcely discover a fault in any work which
savoured of antiquity.<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c012'><sup>[254]</sup></a> The archaic ruggedness of his language,
his uncouth forms, such as <i>axim</i>, <i>tetinerim</i>, <i>egregiissimus</i>, and
his unauthorized constructions, like <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mihi piget</span></i>, were due to the
unsettled state of the Latin language in his days. His strange
combinations, such as <i>repandirostrum</i> and <i>incurvicervicum</i>, may
possibly have been suggested by the study of Greek, and by his
overweening admiration for its facility of composition. But his
polish, pathos, and learning,<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c012'><sup>[255]</sup></a> the harmony of his periods,<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c012'><sup>[256]</sup></a> his
eloquence,<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c012'><sup>[257]</sup></a> his fluency, his word-painting,<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c012'><sup>[258]</sup></a> are peculiarly his own.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tragedies of Pacuvius were not mere translations, but
adaptations of Greek tragedies to the Roman stage. The fragments
which are extant are full of new and original thoughts.
His plots were borrowed from the Greek, but the plan and treatment
were his own. The lyric portion appears to have occupied
an important place in his tragedies, and displays considerable
imaginative power. It is evident that his mind only required
suggestions, and was sufficiently original, to form new combinations.
The titles of thirteen of his tragedies are preserved,<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c012'><sup>[259]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>of which the most celebrated were the “<cite class='quote'>Antiopa</cite>” and “<cite class='quote'>Dulorestes</cite>”
(Orestes in Slavery.) Of the former, the only fragment
extant is one severely criticised by Persius. The latter was
principally founded on the “<cite class='quote'>Iphigenia in Tauris</cite>” of Euripides,<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c012'><sup>[260]</sup></a>
although the author was evidently inspired with the poetical conceptions
of Æschylus. In fact, Pacuvius is less Euripidean than
the other Roman tragic poets. The very roughness of his style
and audacity of his expressions have somewhat of the solemn
grandeur and picturesque boldness which distinguish the father
of Attic tragedy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The subject of the “<cite class='quote'>Dulorestes</cite>” was the adventures of the
son of Agamemnon. When driven from the palace of his ancestors,
he was in exile and in slavery.<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c012'><sup>[261]</sup></a> On the first representation
of this play, the generous friendship of Orestes and Pylades
called forth the most enthusiastic applause from the audience,
who then probably heard the legend for the first time. “What
acclamations,” says Lælius,<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c012'><sup>[262]</sup></a> “resounded through the theatre at
the representation of the new play of my guest and friend, M.
Pacuvius, when the king, being ignorant which of the two was
Orestes, Pylades affirmed that he was Orestes, that he might be
put to death in his place, whilst Orestes persevered in asserting
that he was the man!”</p>

<p class='c011'>One of his plays, “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Paulus</span></cite>,” was a <i>fabula prætextata</i>: its subject
was taken entirely from Roman history, the hero being L.
Æm. Paulus, the conqueror of Perseus. Besides tragedies, the
grammarians have attributed to him one satura.<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c012'><sup>[263]</sup></a> He is said
also to have written comedies; but there is no evidence in favour
of any, with the exception of one, entitled “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mercator</span></cite>.”</p>

</div>
<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>L. Attius</span> (<span class='fss'>BORN ABOUT B. C.</span> 170.)</h4>

<p class='c018'>Although born about fifty years later than Pacuvius,<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c012'><sup>[264]</sup></a> Attius
was almost his contemporary, and a competitor for popular applause.
The amiable old poet lived on the most friendly terms
with his young rival; and A. Gellius tells us that after he withdrew
from the literary society of Rome to retirement at Tarentum,
he on one occasion invited the rising poet to be his guest
for some days, and made him read his tragedy of “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Atreus</span></cite>.”
Pacuvius criticised it kindly, fairly praised the grandeur of the
poetry, but said that it was somewhat harsh and hard. “You
are right,” replied Attius, “but I hope to improve. Fruits
which are at first hard and sour, become soft and mellow, but
those which begin by being soft, end in being rotten.” Valerius
Maximus<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c012'><sup>[265]</sup></a> relates that in the assemblies of the poets he refused
to rise at the entrance of J. Cæsar, because he felt that in the
republic of letters he was the superior. If this anecdote is
genuine, it does not prove that the aged poet was guilty of unwarrantable
self-esteem, for Cæsar must then have been quite a
youth, and if he had any claim to reputation as a poet, he was,
at any rate, not yet distinguished as a warrior or a statesman.
Amongst the great men whose friendship the poet enjoyed was
Dec. Brutus, who was consul <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;C.</span> 616.<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c012'><sup>[266]</sup></a> Nothing more is
known respecting his private history, except that his parents were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>freedmen, and that he was one of the colonists settled at Pisaurum,
where, in after times, a farm or estate (fundus Attianus)
continued to bear his name. His tragedies were very numerous.
He is said to have written more than fifty. Three at least were
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prætextatæ</span></i>, their titles being “<cite class='quote'>Brutus</cite>,” “<cite class='quote'>The Æneadæ</cite>,” or “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Decius</span></cite>,”<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c012'><sup>[267]</sup></a>
and “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Marcellus</span></cite>.” His “<cite class='quote'>Trachiniæ</cite>” and “<cite class='quote'>Phœnissæ</cite>”
were almost translations, the one from Sophocles, the other from
Euripides; the rest were free imitations of Greek tragedies.
They were distinguished both for sublimity and pathos; and although
he was warmed by the fiery spirit and tragic grandeur
of Æschylus, he evidently evinced a predilection for Sophocles.<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c012'><sup>[268]</sup></a>
His taste is chastened, his sentiments noble, his versification elegant.
His language is almost classical, and was deservedly admired
by the ancients for its polish as well as its vigour. The
“<cite class='quote'>Brutus</cite>” was written at the suggestion of his friend Decimus.
The plot was the expulsion of the Tarquins, the hero Brutus, the
heroine Lucretia. He had chosen one of the noblest romances
in Roman history. Two passages,<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c012'><sup>[269]</sup></a> quoted by Cicero, are all that
remain of this national tragedy. In them the tyrant relates to
the augurs a dream which had haunted him, and they, at his request,
give their interpretation of it. Varro has also preserved
the soliloquy of Hercules in the agonies of death, from the Trachiniæ,<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c012'><sup>[270]</sup></a>
a noble paraphrase of Sophocles. This fine specimen
of his genius extends to the length of forty-five lines. In another
passage, Philoctetes pours forth his sufferings in language
as touching as the original Greek; and in a third, Prometheus,
now delivered from the tyranny of Jupiter, addresses to his assembled
Titans a strain of indignant eloquence not unworthy of
Æschylus.<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c012'><sup>[271]</sup></a> The following lines from the “<cite class='quote'>Phœnissæ</cite>” and the
“<cite class='quote'>Complaint of Philoctetes</cite>,” are, though brief, fair examples of
his language and versification:——</p>

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>These are the most important of the numerous fragments
which are extant of the various tragedies of the lofty Attius.<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c012'><sup>[274]</sup></a>
He has been considered by some as the founder of the <i>Tragœdia
Prætextatæ</i>. This, however, is not true, for there is no doubt
that such dramas were written by his predecessors. Nevertheless,
he brought the natural tragedy to its highest state of
perfection.</p>

<p class='c011'>The time was now evidently approaching when the Romans
were beginning to show, that although they did not possess the
inventive genius of the Greeks, they were capable of stripping
their native language of its rudeness, and of transferring into
it the beauties of Greek thought; that they were no longer
mere servile copyists, but could use Greek poetry as furnishing
suggestions for original efforts. They could not quarry for
themselves, but they could now build up Greek materials into a
glowing and polished edifice, of which the details were new
and the effect original.</p>

<p class='c011'>The metres which Attius used were chiefly the iambic trimeter
and the anapæstic dimeter, but his <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">prætextatæ</span></i> were written
in trochaic and iambic tetrameters, the rhythm of which proves
that his ear was more refined than that of his predecessors.<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c012'><sup>[275]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>It is not known whether he was the author of any comedies,
but he was a historian, an antiquarian, and a critic, as well as a
poet. He left behind him a review of dramatic poetry, entitled
“<cite>Libri Didascalion</cite>,” “<cite class='quote'>Roman Annals</cite>,” in verse, and two other
works—“<cite>Libri Pragmaticon</cite>,” and “<cite>Parerga</cite>.” The former of
these is quoted by Nonius, and A. Gellius. He died at an advanced
age, probably about <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;C.</span> 670, and is thus a link, as it
were, which connects the first literary period with the age of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Cicero; for the great orator was personally acquainted with
him, and at his death must have been about twenty-two years
of age.</p>

<p class='c011'>With Attius Latin tragedy disappeared. The tragedies of
the third period were written expressly for reading and recitation,
and not for the stage. They may have deserved the commendations
which they obtained, but the merit and talent which
they displayed were simply rhetorical, and not dramatic; they
were dramatic poems, not dramas.</p>

<p class='c011'>The state of political affairs, which synchronized with the
death of Attius, was less congenial than ever to the tragic muse.
Real and bloody tragedies were being enacted, and there was
no room in the heart of the Roman people for fictitious woes.
If it was improbable that a people who delighted in the sanguinary
scenes of the amphitheatre should sympathize with the
sorrows of a hero in tragedy, it was almost impossible that tragedy
should flourish when Rome itself was a theatre in which
scenes of horror were daily enacted.</p>

<p class='c011'>Either then, or not long before, the terrible domination of
Cinna and Marius had begun. Massacre and violence raged
through the streets of Rome. The best and noblest fell victims
to the raging thirst for blood. The aged Marius, distracted by
unscrupulous ambition and savage passions, died amidst the delirious
ravings of remorse, and thus made way for the tyranny of
his perjured accomplice Cinna. Still there was no respite or
interruption. The cruel Sulla sent his orders from Antemnæ
to slaughter 8,000 prisoners in cold blood. The massacre had
hardly begun when he himself arrived, had taken his place in
the Senate; and the shrieks of his murdered victims were
audible in the house whilst he was coolly speaking. This was
the beginning of horrors: the notorious proscription followed.
Besides other victims, 5,600 Roman knights perished.</p>

<p class='c011'>Amidst such scenes as these, the voice of the tragic muse was
hushed. Depending for her very existence on the breath of
popular favour, she necessarily could not find supporters, and
so languished and was silenced. It might appear surprising that
literature of any kind should have lived through such times of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>savage barbarism. But other literature is not dependent upon
public patronage: it finds a refuge beneath the shelter of the
private dwelling. The literary man finds friends and patrons
amongst those who, devoted to the humanities of intellectual
pursuits, shuns the scenes of revolutionary strife and the
struggles of selfish ambition. Even Sulla himself had a
polished and refined taste; and, when he resigned the Dictatorship,
passed those hours of retirement in literary studies which
were not devoted to depravity and licentiousness.</p>

<p class='c011'>The style in which the Roman theatres were built, indicate
that whatever taste for tragedy the Roman people possessed had
now decayed. The huge edifice erected by Pompey was too
vast for the exhibition of tragedy. The forty thousand spectators
which it contained could scarcely hear the actor, still less
could they see the expression of human passions and emotions.
The two theatres, placed on pivots, back to back, so that they could
be wheeled round and form one vast amphitheatre, show how an
interest in the drama was shared with the passion for spectacle;
and provision was thus publicly made for gratifying that corrupt
taste which had arrived at its zenith in the time of Horace, and,
as we have seen, interrupted even comedy so early as the times
of Terence.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Satire.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The invention of satire is universally attributed to the Romans,
and this assertion is true as far as the external form is
concerned; but the spirit of satire is found in many parts of the
literature of Greece. It animated the Homeric Margites, the
poem on woman by Simonides, the bitter lyrical iambics of
Archilochus, Stesichorus’ attack on Helen, and especially, as
Horace says, the old comedy of Eupolis, Cratinus, and Aristophanes.
Some resemblance may also be discerned between Roman
satire and the Greek Silli, poems belonging to the declining
period of Greek literature,<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c012'><sup>[276]</sup></a> the design of which was to attack
vice and folly with severe ridicule.<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c012'><sup>[277]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Satire is, in fact, if Horace may be believed, the form which
comedy took amongst the people with whom the drama did not
flourish. Ennius was the inventor of the name, but Lucilius<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c012'><sup>[278]</sup></a>
was the father of satire, in the proper sense, and was at Rome
what the writers of the old comedy were at Athens. It subsequently
occupied a wider field: Persius and Juvenal confined
themselves to its didactic purpose, but Horace made it a vehicle
for the narration of amusing adventure, and picturesque descriptions
of human life.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Satires of Lucilius mark an era in Roman literature, and
prove that a love for this species of poetry had already made
great progress. Hitherto, science, literature, and art, had been
considered the province of slaves and freedmen. The stern old
Roman virtue despised such sedentary and inactive employment
as intellectual cultivation, and thought it unworthy of the warrior
and statesman. Some of the higher classes loved literature
and patronised it, but did not make it their pursuit. Cato
blamed M. Fulvius Nobilior for being accompanied by poets
when he proceeded to his provincial government,<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c012'><sup>[279]</sup></a> and did not
until advanced in years undertake to study Greek.<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c012'><sup>[280]</sup></a> C. Lucilius
was by birth of equestrian rank, the first Roman knight who
was himself a poet.<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c012'><sup>[281]</sup></a> He was born at Suessa Aurunca, <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 148,<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c012'><sup>[282]</sup></a>
and lived to the age of forty-six years.<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c012'><sup>[283]</sup></a> At fourteen, he served
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>under Scipio at the siege of Numantia.<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c012'><sup>[284]</sup></a> He was the maternal
great-uncle of Pompey, and numbered amongst his friends and
patrons, Africanus and Lælius. His Satires were comprised
in thirty books, of which the first twenty and the thirtieth
were written in hexameters, the rest in iambics or trochaics.
Numerous fragments are still extant, some of considerable length.
The Satires were probably arranged according to their subject-matter;
for those in the first book are on topics connected with
religion, whilst those in the ninth treat of literary and grammatical
criticism. His versification is careless and unrefined;
very inferior in this respect to that of his predecessors. He
sets at defiance the laws of prosody, and almost returns to the
usage of that period in which the ear was the only judge.</p>

<p class='c011'>The prejudices of Horace<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c012'><sup>[285]</sup></a> against the ancient Roman literature
render him an unsafe guide in criticism. Even in his own
time his attacks were considered by some indefensible; but his
strictures on the style of Lucilius are not undeserved; it was
unmusical, affected, and incorrect. His sentences are frequently
ill-arranged, and therefore deficient in perspicuity. His mixture
of Greek and Latin expressions, without that skill and art
with which Horace considered it allowable to enrich the vernacular
language, is itself offensive to good taste, and is rendered
still more disagreeable by unnecessary diminutives and forced
alliteration. On these grounds, and on these alone, he merits
the contemptuous criticism of Horace.</p>

<p class='c011'>His real defect was want of facility; and it is not improbable
that, if prose had been considered a legitimate vehicle, he
would have preferred pouring forth in that unrestricted form his
indignant eloquence, rather than that, as Horace says, every
verse should have cost him many scratchings of the head, and
biting his nails to the quick. Whilst the criticism of Horace
errs on the side of severity, that of Cicero<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c012'><sup>[286]</sup></a> is somewhat
too partial: firstly, because he himself was deficient in poetical
facility; secondly, because in his time there were no models of
perfection wherewith to compare the works of Lucilius. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>judgment of Quintilian<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c012'><sup>[287]</sup></a> is moderate; and although the taste for
poetry was then corrupted by a love of quietness and rhetorical
affectation, the praise is well merited which he bestows on the
frank honesty and biting wit of the Satires of Lucilius. As
he took the writers of old Attic comedy for his models, it cannot
be a matter of surprise that he occasionally added force to
his attacks on vice by coarseness and personality. Like them,
if Lucilius found any one who deserved rebuke for his crimes,
he did not trouble himself to make general remarks, and to attack
vice in the abstract, but to illustrate his principles by
living examples.</p>

<p class='c011'>The education of Lucilius had probably been desultory, and
his course of study not sufficiently strict to give the rich young
Roman knight the accurate training, the critical knowledge, necessary
to make him a poet as well as a satirist. It had given
him learning and erudition—it had furnished him with the wealth
of two languages, both of which he used whenever he thought
they supplied him with a two-edged weapon—but it had not
sufficiently cultivated his ear and refined his taste. On the other
hand, his Satires must have possessed nobler qualities than those
of style. He was evidently a man of high moral principle,
though stern and stoical, devotedly attached to the cause of
virtue, a relentless enemy of vice and profligacy, a gallant and
fearless defender of truth and honesty. He must have felt with
Juvenal, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">difficile est satiram non scribere</span>.” He was under an
obligation which he could not avoid. What cared he for correct
tetrameters, or heroics, or senarii, so that he could crush effeminacy,
and gluttony, and self-indulgence, and restore the standard
of ancient morals, to which he looked back with admiration?</p>

<p class='c011'>This chivalrous devotion inspired him with eloquence, and
gave a dignity to his rude verses, although it did not invest
them with the graces and charms of poetry. Nor is it only
when he declares open war against corruption that he must
have made his adversaries tremble, or his victims, conscience-stricken,
writhe beneath his knife. His encomiums upon virtue
form as striking pictures; but in both it is the masterly outline
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>of the drawing which amazes and instructs, not the mere accessory
of the colouring. See, for example, the following noble passage,
with its unselfish conclusion, preserved by Lactantius:<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c012'><sup>[288]</sup></a>—</p>

<p class='c011'>Had they been extant, we should have found useful information
and instruction in his faithful pictures of Roman life and manners
in their state of moral transition—amusement in such pieces
as his journal of a progress from Rome to Capua, from which
Horace borrowed the idea of his journey to Brundisium, whilst
in his love poems, addressed to his mistress, Collyra, we should
have traced the tender sympathies of human nature, which the
sternness of stoicism was unable to overcome.</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides satire, Lucilius is said to have attempted lyric poetry:
if this be the case, it is by no means surprising that no specimens
have stood the test of time, for he possessed none of the
qualifications of a lyric poet.</p>

<p class='c011'>After the death of Lucilius, satire languished. Varro Atacinus
attempted it and failed.<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c012'><sup>[289]</sup></a> Half a century subsequently it
assumed a new garb in the descriptive scenes of Horace, and
put forth its original vigour in the burning thoughts of Persius
and Juvenal.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>LÆVIUS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>This literary period was entirely destitute of lyric poetry,
unless Niebuhr is correct in supposing that Lævius flourished
contemporaneously with Lucilius.<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c012'><sup>[290]</sup></a> Nothing is known of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>history; and such uncertainty prevails respecting him that his
name is constantly confounded with those of Livius and Nævius.
It is not improbable, that some passages attributed to them,
which appear to belong to a later literary age, are, in reality,
the work of Lævius—for example, the hexameters which are
found in the Latin Odyssey of Livius. He translated the Cyprian
poems, and wrote some fugitive amatory pieces entitled Erotopægnia.
They seem to have possessed neither the graceful simplicity
nor the tender warmth which are essential to lyric
poetry, although they perhaps attained as great elegance of expression
as the state of the language then admitted. Short
fragments are preserved by Apuleius and in the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Noctes Atticæ</span></cite>
of A. Gellius.<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c012'><sup>[291]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Prose was far more in accordance with the genius of the
Romans than poetry. As a nation they had little or no ideality
or imaginative power, no enthusiastic love of natural beauty, no
acute perception of the sympathy and relation existing between
man and the external world. In the Greek mind a love of
country and a love of nature held a divided empire—they were
poets as well as patriots. Roman patriotism had indeed its
dark side—an unbounded lust of dominion, an unscrupulous
ambition to extend the power and glory of the republic;
but, nevertheless, it prompted a zealous devotion to whatever
would promote national independence and social advancement.
Statesmanship, therefore, and the subjects akin to it, constituted
the favourite civil pursuit of an enlightened Roman, who sought
a distinguished career of public usefulness; and, therefore, that
literature which tended to advance the science of social life had
a charm for him which no other literature possessed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The branches of knowledge which would engage his attention
were History, Jurisprudence, and Oratory. They would
be studied with a view to utility, and in a practical spirit they
would require a scientific and not an artistic treatment; and,
therefore, their natural language would be prose and not poetry.
As matter was more valued than manner by this utilitarian
people, it was long before it was thought necessary to embellish
prose literature with the graces of composition. The earliest orators
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>spoke with a rude and vigorous eloquence which is always
captivating: they wrote but little; their style was stiff and dry, and
very inferior to their speaking. Cato’s prose was less rugged
than that of his contemporaries or even his immediate successors.
Sisenna was the first historian to whom gracefulness and
polish have been attributed; and C. Gracchus is spoken of as a
single exception to the orators of his age, on account of the
rhythmical modulation of his prose sentences—a quality which
he probably owed not more to a delicate ear than to the softening
influence of a mother’s education. Even the prose of that
celebrated model of refinement and good taste, C. Lælius, was
harsh and unmusical.<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c012'><sup>[292]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Besides the influence which the practical character of the
Roman mind exercised upon prose writing, it must not be forgotten
that Roman literature was imitative: its end and object,
therefore, were not invention, but erudition; it depended for its
existence on learning, and was almost synonymous with it.
This principle gave a decidedly historical bias to the Roman intellect:
an historical taste pervades a great portion of the national
literature. There is a manifest tendency to study subjects
in an historical point of view. It will be seen hereafter
that it is not like the Greek, original and inventive, but erudite
and eclectic. The historic principle is the great characteristic
feature of the Roman mind; consequently, in this branch of
literature, the Romans attained the highest reputation, and may
fairly stand forth as competitors with their Greek instructors.
Not that they ever entirely equalled them; for though they were
practical, vigorous, and just thinkers, they never attained that
comprehensive and philosophical spirit which distinguished the
Greek historians.</p>

<p class='c011'>The work of an historian was, in the earliest times, recognised
as not unworthy of a Roman. It was not like the other branches
of literature, in which the example was first set by slaves and
freedmen. Those who first devoted themselves to the pursuit
were also eminent in the public service of their country. Fabius
Pictor was of an illustrious patrician family.  Cincius Alimentus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Fulvius Nobilior, and others, were of free and honourable birth.
Such were Roman historians until the time of Sulla; for L. Otacilius
Pilitus,<a id='t164'></a> who flourished at that period, was the first freedman
who began to write history.<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c012'><sup>[293]</sup></a><a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c012'><sup>[294]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Again, the science of jurisprudence formed an indispensable
part of statesmanship. It was a study which recommended itself
by its practical nature: it could not be stigmatized even by the
busiest as an idle and frivolous pursuit, whilst the constitutional
relation which subsisted between patron and client, rendered
the knowledge of its principles, to a certain extent, absolutely
necessary. Protection from wrong was the greatest boon which
the strong could confer upon the weak, the learned on the unlearned.
It was, therefore, the most efficacious method of gaining
grateful and attached friends; and by their support, the direct
path was opened to the highest political positions. It is not,
therefore, to be wondered at that, even when elegant literature
was in its infancy, so many names are found of men illustrious
as jurists and lawyers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Practical statesmanship, in like manner, gave an early encouragement
to oratory. It is peculiarly the literature of active
life. The possession of eloquence rendered a man more efficient
as a soldier and as a citizen. Great as is the force of native, unadorned
eloquence, vigorous common sense, honest truthfulness,
and indignant passion, nature would give way to art as taste
became more cultivated. Nor could the Romans long have the
finished models of Greek eloquence before their eyes, without
transferring to the forum or the senate-house somewhat of their
simple grandeur and majestic beauty.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first efforts of the Roman historians were devoted to the
transfer of the records of poetry into prose, as their more appropriate
and popular vehicle. The national lays which tradition
had handed down were the storehouses which they ransacked
to furnish a supply of materials. As far as the records of authentic
history are concerned, they performed the functions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>simple annalists: they related events almost in the style of public
monuments, without any attempt at ornament, without picturesque
detail or political reflection. When Cicero compares the style
of Fabius Pictor, Cato, and Piso, to that of the old Greek logographers,<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c012'><sup>[295]</sup></a>
Pherecydes, Hellanicus, and Acusilaus, the points of
resemblance which he instances are, that both neglected ornament,
were careful only that their statements should be intelligible,
and thought the chief excellence of a writer was brevity.
Probably the subject-matter of the Roman annalists was the
more valuable, whilst the Greeks had the advantage in liveliness
and skill. Some of the earliest historians wrote in Greek instead
of Latin. Even, in later times, such men as Sulla and Lucullus,
and also Cn. Aufidius, who flourished during the boyhood of
Cicero, wrote their memoirs in a foreign tongue. There was
some reason for this. The language in which the higher classes
received their education was Greek—the tutors, even the nurses,
were Greek, as well as the librarians, secretaries, and confidential
servants in most distinguished families. Such was the humanizing
spirit of literature that these distinguished foreigners found
an asylum in the households of noble Romans, notwithstanding
the severity with which the law treated prisoners of war. Fashionable
conversation, moreover, was interlarded with Greek
phrases, and, in some houses, Greek was habitually spoken.
Even so late as the times of Cicero,<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c012'><sup>[296]</sup></a> Greek literature was read
and studied in almost every part of the civilized world, while
the works of Latin writers were only known within the circumscribed
limits of Italy.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Q. Fabius Pictor.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The most ancient prose writer of Roman history was Q. Fabius
Pictor, the contemporary of Nævius. He belonged to that
branch of the noble house of the Fabii, which derived its distinguishing
appellation from the eminence of its founder as a
painter. The temple of Salus, which he painted, was dedicated
B. C. 302, by the dictator, C. Junius Bubulcus; and this oldest
known specimen of Roman fine art remained until the conflagration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>of the temple in the reign of Claudius. It must, therefore,
have been subjected to the criticisms of an age capable of forming
a correct judgment respecting its merits; and it appears from
the testimony of antiquity to have possessed the two essentials
of accurate drawing and truthful colouring, and to have been
free from the fault of conventional treatment.<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c012'><sup>[297]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The Fabii were an intellectual family as well as a distinguished
one: perhaps the numerous records of their exploits which exist
were, in some degree, owing to their learning. The grandson
of the eminent artist was Fabius Pictor the historian. Livy<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c012'><sup>[298]</sup></a>
continually refers to him, and throughout his narrative of the
Hannibalian war, he professes implicit confidence in him on the
grounds of his being a contemporary historian,<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c012'><sup>[299]</sup></a> (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">æqualem temporibus
hujusce belli</span></i>;) he is likewise the authority on whom the
greatest reliance was placed by Dion Cassius and Appian. Nor
did the accurate and faithful Polybius consider him otherwise
than trustworthy upon the whole, although he accuses him of
partiality towards his countrymen.<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c012'><sup>[300]</sup></a> Niebuhr<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c012'><sup>[301]</sup></a> attributes to
Fabius Pictor the accurate knowledge of constitutional history
displayed by Dion Cassius, and acknowledges how deeply we
are indebted to him for the information which we possess concerning
the changes which took place in the Roman constitution.
It is to his care that we owe the faithfulness of Dion, whilst
Dionysius and Livy too often lead us astray. It constitutes some
justification of his partiality as an historian, that Philinus of
Agrigentum had also written a history of the first Punic war in
a spirit hostile to Rome, and that this provoked Pictor to a defence
of his country’s honour. His work was written in Greek,
and its principal subject was a history of the first and second
Punic wars, especially that against Hannibal. It has been held
by some, on the authority of a passage in the “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Oratore</span></cite>” of
Cicero,<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c012'><sup>[302]</sup></a> that he wrote in Latin as well as in Greek; but Niebuhr
believes that Cicero is in error, and has confused him with a
Latin annalist, named F. Max. Servilianus. The period to which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>his work extended is uncertain; but the last event alluded to by
Livy, on his authority, is the battle of Trasymenus,<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c012'><sup>[303]</sup></a> and the last
occasion on which he mentions his name is when he records his
return from an embassy to Delphi in the following year.<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c012'><sup>[304]</sup></a> The
earlier history of Rome was prefixed by way of introduction;
for his object was not merely to assist in constructing the rising
edifice of Roman literature, but to spread the glory of his country
throughout that other great nation of antiquity, which now, for
the first time, came in contact with a worthy rival. The pontifical
annals, the national ballads, the annals of his own house, so
rich in legendary tales of heroism, furnished him with ample
materials; but he is also said to have drawn largely on the stores
of a Greek author, named Diocles, a native of Peparethus, who
had preceded him in the work of research and accumulation.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>L. Cincius Alimentus.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Contemporary with Fabius was the other annalist of the second
Punic war, L. Cincius Alimentus. He was prætor in Sicily<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c012'><sup>[305]</sup></a> in
the ninth year of the war, and took a prominent part in it.<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c012'><sup>[306]</sup></a> The
soldiers who fought at Cannæ<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c012'><sup>[307]</sup></a> were placed at his disposal, his
period of command was prolonged, and after his return home he
was sent as <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">legatus</span></i> to the consul Crispinus, on the occasion of
the melancholy death of his colleague, Marcellus.<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c012'><sup>[308]</sup></a> Some time
after this, he was taken prisoner by Hannibal.<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c012'><sup>[309]</sup></a> Like Fabius,
he wrote his work in Greek, and prefixed to it a brief abstract
of early Roman history.<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c012'><sup>[310]</sup></a> Livy speaks of him as a diligent antiquarian,
and appeals to his authority to establish the Etruscan
origin of the custom of the dictator driving a nail into the temple
of Jupiter Optimus Maximus.<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c012'><sup>[311]</sup></a> As his accurate investigation of
original monuments gives a credibility to his early history, so
his being personally engaged in the war in a high position, renders
him trustworthy in the later periods. It is also said that,
when he was a prisoner of war, Hannibal, who delighted in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>society of literary men, treated him with great kindness and
consideration, and himself communicated to him the details of
his passage across the Alps into Italy.</p>

<p class='c011'>To him, therefore, and to the opportunities which he enjoyed
of gaining information, we owe the credibility of this portion of
Livy’s history<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c012'><sup>[312]</sup></a> on a point on which authors were at variance,
namely, the number of Hannibal’s forces at this time. Livy
appeals to the statement of Cincius as settling the question, and
says, Hannibal himself informed Cincius how many troops he
had lost between the passage of the Rhone and his descent into
Italy.</p>

<p class='c011'>His accurate habit of mind must have made his annals a most
valuable work; and, therefore, it was most important that the
variation of his early chronology from that which is commonly
received should be explained and reconciled. This task Niebuhr
has satisfactorily accomplished. He supposes that Cincius took
cyclical years of ten months, which were used previous to the
reign of Tarquinius Priscus, in the place of common years of
twelve months. The time which had elapsed between the
building of Rome and this epoch was, according to the pontifical
annals, 132 years. The error, therefore, due to this miscalculation
would be 132 - <span class='fraction'><span class='under'>132 + 10</span><br />12</span> = 22 years. If this be added to the
common date of the building of Rome, <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 753 = Ol. vii. 2, the
result is the date given by Cincius, namely Ol. vii. 4.<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c012'><sup>[313]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>C. Acilius Glabrio.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>A few words may be devoted to C. Acilius Glabrio, the third
representative of the Græco-Roman historic literature. Very
little is known respecting him. He was quæstor <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;C.</span> 551,
tribune <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;C.</span> 557, and subsequently attained senatorial rank;
for Gellius<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c012'><sup>[314]</sup></a> relates that, when the three Athenian philosophers
visited Rome as ambassadors, Acilius introduced them to the
senate and acted as interpreter. His story was considered worthy
of translation by an author named Claudius, and to this translation
reference is twice made by Livy.<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c012'><sup>[315]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Valuable though the works of these annalists must have been
as historical records, and as furnishing materials for more
thoughtful and philosophical minds, they are only such as could
have existed in the infancy of a national literature. They were
a bare compilation of facts, the mere scaffolding and framework
of history; they were diversified by no critical remarks or political
reflections. The authors made no use of their facts, either
to deduce or to illustrate principles. With respect to style,
they were meager, insipid, and jejune.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>M. Porcius Cato Censorius.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The versatility and variety of talent displayed by Cato claim
for him a place amongst orators, jurists, economists, and historians.
It is, however, amongst the latter, as representatives of
the highest branch of prose literature, that we must speak of
the author of the “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Origines</span></cite>.” His life extends over a wide and
important period of literary history: everything was in a state
of change—morals, social habits, literary taste. Not only the
influence of Greek literature, but also that of the moral and
metaphysical creed of Greek philosophy, was beginning to be
felt when Cato’s manly and powerful intellect was flourishing.
When he filled the second public office to which the Roman
citizen aspired, Nævius was still living. He was censor when
Plautus died; and, before his own life ended, the comedies of
Terence had been exhibited on the Roman stage.</p>

<p class='c011'>Three political events took place during his lifetime, which
must have exercised an important influence on the mental condition
of the Roman people. When Macedonia, at the defeat of
Perseus,<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c012'><sup>[316]</sup></a> was reduced to the condition of a Roman province,
nearly a thousand Achæans, amongst whom was the historian
Polybius, were sent to Rome, and detained in Italy as hostages
during nearly seventeen years. The thirteenth year from that
event witnessed the dawn of philosophy at Rome, for previously
to this epoch, the philosophical schools of Magna Græcia appear
to have been unnoticed and disregarded. But now<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c012'><sup>[317]</sup></a> Carneades
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>the academic, Critolaus the peripatetic, and Diogenes the stoic,<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c012'><sup>[318]</sup></a>
came to Rome as ambassadors from Athens, and delivered philosophical
lectures, which attracted the attention of the leading
statesmen, whilst the doctrines which they taught excited universal
alarm. The following year Crates arrived as ambassador
from Attalus, king of Pergamus, and during his stay delighted
the literary society of the capital with commentaries on the
Greek poets.<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c012'><sup>[319]</sup></a> It is not surprising that one who lived through
a period during which Greek literature had such favourable
opportunities of being propagated by some of its most distinguished
professors, sufficiently overcame his prejudices as to
learn in his old age the language of a people whom he both
hated and despised.</p>

<p class='c011'>M. Porcius Cato Censorius was born at Tusculum, <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 234.<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c012'><sup>[320]</sup></a>
His family was of great antiquity, and numbered amongst its
members many who were distinguished for their courage in war
and their integrity in peace. His boyhood was passed in the
healthy pursuits of rural life, at a small Sabine farm belonging
to his father; and his mind, invigorated by stern and hardy
training, was early directed to the study as well as the practice
of agriculture. To this rugged yet honest discipline may be
traced the features of his character as displayed in after life, his
prejudices as well as his virtues.</p>

<p class='c011'>He became a soldier at a very early age, <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 217, served in
the Hannibalian war, was under the command of Fabius Maximus
both in Campania and Tarentum, and did good service at
the decisive battle of the Metaurus. Between his campaigns he
did not seek to exhibit his laurels in the society of the capital,
but, like Curius Dentatus and Quintius Cincinnatus, employed
himself in the rural labours of his Sabine retirement.</p>

<p class='c011'>His shrewd remarks and easy conversation, as well as the
skill with which he pleaded the causes of his clients before the
rural magistracy, soon made his abilities known, and his reputation
attracted the notice of one of his country neighbours, L.
Valerius Flaccus, who invited him to his town-house at Rome.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Owing to the patronage of his noble friend, and his own merits,
his rise to eminence as a pleader was rapid. He was a quæstor
in <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 206, ædile in <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 199, prætor the following year, and
in <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 195 he obtained the consulship, his patron Flaccus being
now his colleague. His province was Spain;<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c012'><sup>[321]</sup></a> and, whilst stern
and pitiless towards his foes, he exhibited a noble example of
self-denying endurance in order to minister to the welfare of his
army. At the conclusion of his consulship, he served as legatus
in Thrace and Greece; and in <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 189 was sent on a civil mission
to Fulvius Nobilior in Ætolia.</p>

<p class='c011'>After experiencing one failure, he was elected censor in <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span>
184; and he had now an opportunity of making a return for the
obligations which his earliest patron had conferred upon him;
for, by his influence, Flaccus was appointed his colleague. This
office was, above all others, suited to his talents; and to his remarkable
activity in the discharge of his duties, he owes his
fame and his surname.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had now full scope for displaying his habits of business,
his talents for administration, his uncompromising resistance to
all luxury and extravagance, his fearlessness in the reformation
of abuses: and though he was severe, public opinion bore testimony
to his integrity, for he was rewarded with a statue and
an inscription. He had now served his country in every capacity,
but still he gave himself no rest; advancing age did not
weaken his energies; he was always ready as the champion of the
oppressed, the advocate of virtue, the punisher of vice. He
prosecuted the extortionate governors of his old province, Spain.<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c012'><sup>[322]</sup></a>
He pleaded before the senate the cause of the loyal Rhodians.</p>

<p class='c011'>He caused the courteous dismissal of the three Greek philosophers,
because the arguments of Carneades made it difficult to
discern what was truth.<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c012'><sup>[323]</sup></a> Although his prejudice against Greeks
prevented him sympathizing with the sorrows of the Achæan
exiles, he supported the vote for their restoration to their native
land. Neither his enemies nor his country would allow him
rest. In his eighty-sixth year, he had to defend himself against
a capital charge. In his eighty-ninth, he was sent to Africa as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>one of the arbitrators between the Carthaginians and Massinissa,<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c012'><sup>[324]</sup></a>
and in his ninetieth, the year in which he died,<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c012'><sup>[325]</sup></a> his last public
act was the prosecution of Galba for his perfidious treatment of
the conquered Lusitanians.<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c012'><sup>[326]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Cato loved strife, and his long life was one continued combat.
He never found a task too difficult, because difficulty called forth
all his energies, and his strong will and invincible perseverance
insured success. His inherent love of truth made him hate anything
conventional. As a politician, he considered rank valueless,
except it depended upon personal merit; and therefore he
was an unrelenting enemy of the aristocracy. As a moralist, he
indignantly rejected that false gloss of modern fashion which
was superseding the old plainness, and which was, in his opinion,
the foundation of his country’s glory. In literature, he distrusted
and condemned every thing Greek, because he confounded
the sentiments of its noblest periods as a nation with
those of the degenerate Greeks with whom he came in contact.
But, at length, his candid and truthful disposition discovered
and confessed his error on this point, and his prejudices gave
way before conviction.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cato, with all his virtues, was a hard-hearted man.<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c012'><sup>[327]</sup></a> He had
no amiability, no love, no affection; he did not love right, for
he loved nothing; but he had a burning indignation against
wrong. This was the mainspring of his conduct. He did not
feel for the oppressed, but he declared war against the oppressor.
He never could sympathize with living men. In his youth, all
his admiration was for the past generation. In his old age, his
feeling was that his life had been spent with the past, and he
had nothing in common with the present.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>As is usually the case with those who live during a period of
transition, his feelings were so interested in that past by which
his character was formed, that he was incapable of discerning
any good whatever in change and progress. For this reason he
dreaded the invasion of refinement and civilization. Accustomed
to connect virtue and purity with the absence of temptations,
he was prepared to take an exaggerated view of the relation
between polish and effeminacy, between a taste for the
beautiful and luxury.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was a bitter hater of those who opposed his prejudices.
His enmity to Carthage sprung much more from his antagonism
to Scipio, as the leader of the Greek or movement party, than
from fears for the safety of Rome. Scipio said, Let Carthage
be; therefore Cato’s will was, let Carthage be destroyed. When
his hatred of injustice was aroused, as, for example, by the perfidy
of S. Sulpicius Galba towards the Lusitanians, he could support
the cause of foreigners against a fellow-countryman. His
character is full of apparent inconsistencies. Although he hated
oppression, he was cruel to his slaves; tyrannical and implacable,
simply because he would not brook opposition to his will.
His integrity was incorruptible, and yet he was a grinding
usurer; frugal in his habits, and notwithstanding his few wants,
grasping and avaricious; but it was his love of business that he
was gratifying, rather than a love of money. Trade was with him
a combat in which he would not allow an advantage to be gained
by his adversary. Virtue did not present itself to Cato in an
amiable form. He had but one idea of it—austerity; and, as his
hatred of wrong was not counterbalanced by a love of right, the
intensity of his hatred was only kept in check by the practical
good sense and utilitarian views which occupy so prominent a
place in the Roman character. Being himself reserved and undemonstrative,
he expected others to be so likewise, and thought
it unbecoming the dignity of a Roman to exhibit tenderness of
feeling. On one occasion we are told that he degraded a Roman
knight for embracing his wife in the presence of his daughter.
His personal appearance was not more prepossessing than his
manners, as we learn from the following severe epigram:—<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c012'><sup>[328]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>As, notwithstanding his defects, Cato was morally the greatest
man ever Rome produced, so he was one of the greatest intellectually.
His genius was perfectly original; his character was
not moulded by other men; he had no education except self-education.
He had immense power of acquiring learning, and
he ransacked every source to increase his stores; but he was indebted
to no man for his opinions—they were self-formed, except
those which he inherited, and in which his own independent convictions
led him to acquiesce. He had the ability and the determination
to excel in everything which he undertook, politics,
war, rural economy, oratory, history. His style is rude, unpolished,
ungraceful, because to him wit was artifice, and polish
superficial, and therefore unreal. For this reason he did not
profit by the inconceivably rapid change which was then taking
place in the Latin language, and which is evident from the
comparison of the fragments of Cato’s works with the polished
comedies of Terence.</p>

<p class='c011'>His statements, however, were clear and transparent; his illustrations,
though quaint, were striking; the words with which
he enriched his native tongue were full of meaning; his wit was
keen and lively, although he never would permit it to offend
against gravity, or partake of irreverence.<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c012'><sup>[329]</sup></a> His arguments
went straight to the intellect, and carried conviction with them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The character of Cato forms one of the most beautiful passages
in the works of Livy:<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c012'><sup>[330]</sup></a> “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In hoc viro tanta vis animi
ingeniique fuit, ut, quocunque loco natus esset, fortunam sibi
ipse facturus fuisse videretur. Nulla ars, neque privatæ, neque
publicæ rei gerendæ, ei defuit. Urbanas rusticasque res pariter

sic pariter ad omnia fuit, ut natum ad id unum diceres, quodcunque

</div>

<p class='c010'>Cato’s great historical and antiquarian work, “<cite class='quote'>The Origines</cite>,”
was written in his old age.<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c012'><sup>[331]</sup></a> Its title would seem to
imply that it was merely an inquiry into the ancient history of
his country; but in reality it comprehended far more than this—it
was a history of Italy and Rome from the earliest times to
the latest events which occurred in his own lifetime. The contents
of the work are thus described by Cornelius Nepos.<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c012'><sup>[332]</sup></a> It is
divided into seven books. The first treats of the history of
the kings; the second and third of the rise and progress of the
Italian states; the fourth contains the first Punic war; the fifth
the war with Hannibal; the remaining two the history of the
subsequent wars down to the prætorship of Servius Galba.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a work of great research and originality. For his
archæological information, he had consulted the records and
documents, not only of Rome, but of the principal Italian towns.
It is probable that their constitutional history was introduced
incidentally to the main narrative; and that the rise and progress
of the Roman constitution was illustrated by the political
principles of the Italian nations. The “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Origines</span></cite>” also contained
valuable notices respecting the history and constitution
of Carthage,<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c012'><sup>[333]</sup></a>  his embassy having furnished him with full opportunity
for collecting materials. It was, in fact, a unique work:
no other Roman historian wrote in the same spirit, or was
equally laborious in the work of original investigation.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>The truthfulness and honesty of Cato must have rendered
the contemporary part of the history equally valuable with the
antiquarian portion. He could not have been guilty of flattery,
he had no regard for the feelings of individuals. Not only he
never mentions himself, but, except in times long gone by, he
never names any one.<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c012'><sup>[334]</sup></a> The glory of a victory, or of a gallant
exploit, belongs to the general, or consul, or tribune, as the representative
of the republic. He does not allow either individual
or family to participate in that which he considered the
exclusive property of his country.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sufficient fragments of the “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Origines</span></cite>” remain to make us regret
that more have not been preserved; but though very numerous,
they are, with the exception of two, excessively brief.
One of these is a portion of his own speech in favour of the
Rhodians;<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c012'><sup>[335]</sup></a> the other a simple and affecting narrative of an act
of self-devoted heroism. A consular army was surprised and
surrounded by the Carthaginians in a defile, from which there
was no escape. The tribune, whom Cato does not name, but
who, as A. Gellius informs us, was Cædicius, went to the consul
and recommended him to send four hundred men to occupy a
neighbouring height. The enemy, he added, will attack them,
and without doubt they will be slain to a man. Nevertheless,
whilst the enemy is thus occupied, the army will escape. But,
replied the consul, who will be the leader of this band? I will,
said the tribune; I devote my life to you, and to my country.
The tribune and four hundred men set forth to die. They sold
their lives dearly, but all fell. “The immortal gods,” adds
Cato, for Gellius is here quoting his very words, “granted the
tribune a lot according to his valour. For thus it came to pass.
Though he had received many wounds, none proved mortal;
and when his comrades recognised him amongst the dead, faint
from loss of blood, they took him up, and he recovered. But
it makes a vast difference in what country a generous action is
performed. Leonidas, of Lacedæmon, is praised, who performed
a similar exploit at Thermopylæ. On account of his valour
united Greece testified her gratitude in every possible way, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>adorned his exploit with monumental records, pictures, statues,
eulogies, histories. The Roman tribune gained but faint praise,
and yet he had done the same, and saved the republic.” The
most pathetic writer could not have told the tale more effectively
than the stern Cato.</p>

<p class='c011'>Circumstances invest his treatise “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Re Rustica</span></cite>” with great
interest. The population of Rome, both patrician and plebeian,
was necessarily agricultural. For centuries they had little commerce:
their wealth consisted in flocks and herds, and in the
conquered territories of nations as poor as themselves. The
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ager Romanus</span></i>, and subsequently as they gained fresh acquisitions,
the fertile plains, and valleys, and mountain sides of Italy,
supplied them with maintenance. The statesman and the general,
in the intervals of civil war or military service, returned, like
Cincinnatus and Cato, to the cultivation of their fields and gardens.
The Roman armies were recruited from the peasantry;
and when the war was over, the soldier returned to his daily
labour; and, in later times, the veteran, when his period of service
was completed, became a small farmer in a military colony.
To a restless nation, who could not exist in a state of inactivity,
a change of labour was relaxation; and the pleasures of rural
life, which were so often sung by the Augustan poets, were
heartily enjoyed by the same man whose natural atmosphere
seemed to be either politics or war.</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides the possession of these rural tastes the Romans were
essentially a domestic people. The Greeks were social; they lived
in public; they had no idea of home. Woman did not with them
occupy a position favourable to the existence of home-feeling.
The Roman matron was the centre of the domestic circle; she was
her husband’s equal, sometimes his counsellor, and generally the
educator of his children in their early years. Hundreds of sepulchral
inscriptions bear testimony to the sweet charities of home-life,
to the dutiful obedience of children, the devoted affection
of parents, the fidelity of wives, the attachments of husbands.
Hence, home and all its pursuits and occupations had an interest
in the eyes of a Roman. For this reason there were so many
writers on rural and domestic economy. From Cato to Columella
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>we have a list of authors whose object was instruction in
the various branches of the subject. They were thus enumerated
by Columella himself:<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c012'><sup>[336]</sup></a> “Cato was the first who taught the art
of agriculture to speak in Latin; after him it was improved by
the diligence of the two Sasernæ, father and son; next it acquired
eloquence from Scrofa Tremellius; polish from M. Terentius,
(Varro;) poetic power from Virgil.” To their illustrious names
he adds those of J. Hyginus, the Carthaginian Mago, Corn.
Celsus, J. Atticus, and his disciple J. Græcinus.</p>

<p class='c011'>The work of Cato, “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Re Rustica</span></cite>,” has come down to us
almost in form and substance as it was written. It has not the
method of a regular treatise. It is a commonplace-book of agriculture
and domestic economy under one hundred and sixty-three
heads. The subjects are connected, but not regularly
arranged; they form a collection of useful instructions, hints,
and receipts. Its object is utility, not science. It serves the
purposes of a farmers’ and gardeners’ manual; a domestic medicine,
an herbal, and cookery-book; prudential maxims are
interspersed, and some favourite charms for the cure of diseases
in man and beast. Cato teaches his readers, for example, how
to plant ozier-beds, to cultivate vegetables, to preserve the
health of cattle, to pickle pork, and to make savoury dishes.
He is shrewd and economical, but he never allows humanity to
interfere with profits; for he recommends his readers to sell
every thing which they do not want, even old horses and old
slaves. He is a great conjurer, for he informs us that the most
potent cure for a sprain is the repetition of the following hocus-pocus:<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c012'><sup>[337]</sup></a>
“Daries dardaries, astataries dissunapitea;” or, “Huat
hanat, huat hista, pista sista, domiabo damnaustra;” or, “Huat
huat, huat, ista sis tar sis, ordannabon damnaustra.” This miscellaneous
collection is preceded by an introduction, in which is
maintained the superiority of agriculture over other modes of
gaining a livelihood, especially over that of trade and money-lending.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Cato was a conscientious father. He could not trust Greeks,
but undertook the education of his son himself. As a part of
his system, he addressed to him, in the form of letters, instruction
on various topics—historical, philosophical, and moral. A
very few fragments of this work, unfortunately, remain. In
one of them he recommends a cursory view of Greek literature,
but not a profound study of it. He evidently considered Greek
writings morally dangerous; but he entertained a still greater
horror of their medicine. He had confidence in his own old-fashioned
charms and rural pharmacopeia; but he firmly believed,
as he would the voice of an oracle, that all the Greek
physicians were banded together to destroy the Romans as barbarians.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the orations of Cato, ninety titles are extant, together
with numerous fragments.<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c012'><sup>[338]</sup></a> Some of these were evidently judicial,
but the majority deliberative. After what has been said of
his works it is scarcely necessary to describe the style of his
eloquence. Unless a man is a mere actor, his character is generally
exemplified in his speaking. This is especially true of
Cato. He despised art. He was too fearless and upright, too
confident in the justice of his cause, to be a rhetorician; too
much wrapt up in his subject to be careful of the language in
which he conveyed his thoughts. He imitated no one, and no
one was ever able to imitate him. His style was abrupt, concise,
witty, full of contrast; its beauty that of nature, namely,
the rapid alternations of light and shade. Now it was rude and
harsh, now pathetic and affecting. It was the language of debate—antagonistic,
gladiatorial, elenchtic.</p>

<p class='c011'>Plutarch compares him to Socrates; but he omits the principal
point of resemblance, namely, that he always speaks as if he
was hand to hand with an adversary. Even amidst the glitter
and polish of the Augustan age, old Cato had some admirers.<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c012'><sup>[339]</sup></a>
But this was not the general feeling. The intrinsic value of the
rough gem was not appreciated. Cicero<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c012'><sup>[340]</sup></a> tells us that, to his
astonishment, Cato was almost entirely unknown. The time
afterwards arrived when criticism became a science, and he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>estimated as he deserved to be; but this admiration for the antique
form was not a revival of the antique spirit; it was only
an attempt to compensate for its loss; it was an imitation, not
a reality.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such was the literary position occupied by him whom Niebuhr
pronounces to be the only great man in his generation, and one
of the greatest and most honourable characters in Roman history.<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c012'><sup>[341]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>L. Cassius Hemina.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>There was no one worthy to follow Cato as an historian but
L. Cassius Hemina. A. Postumius Albinus, consul B. C. 151,
was, according to Cicero,<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c012'><sup>[342]</sup></a> a learned and eloquent man, and wrote
a history of Rome in Greek;<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c012'><sup>[343]</sup></a> but it was so inelegant that he
apologized on the ground that he was a Roman writing in a foreign
language.<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c012'><sup>[344]</sup></a> It is probable, also, that he was inaccurate and
puerile. He tells us, for example, that Baiæ was so named after
Boia, the nurse of one of Æneas’ friends, and that Brutus used
to eat green figs and honey.<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c012'><sup>[345]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Hemina wrote Roman annals in five or six books, and published
them about the time of the fall of Carthage:<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c012'><sup>[346]</sup></a> a considerable
number of fragments are extant. He was the last writer of this
period who investigated the original sources of history. His
researches went back to very early times; and he appears to
have attempted, at least, a comparison of Greek and Italian
chronology, for he fixes the age of Homer and Hesiod in the
dynasty of the Silvii, more than 160 years after the siege of
Troy. He relates the original legend of Cacus and the oxen of
Hercules, the finding of Numa’s coffin, and the celebration of the
fourth sæcular games in the consulship of Lentulus and Mummius.<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c012'><sup>[347]</sup></a>
This was probably the last event of importance previous
to the publication of his work. Only two fragments are of sufficient
length to enable us to form any judgment respecting his
style. Many of his expressions are very archaic, but the story
of Cacus is told in a simple and pleasing manner.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>After Hemina, Roman history was, for some years, nothing
more than a compilation from the old chronicles, and from the
labours and investigations of previous authors. Q. Fabius
Maximus Servilianus was consul <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;C.</span> 612. His Latin style
must have been very deficient in euphony, if he frequently indulged
in such words as <i>litterosissimum</i>, which occurs in one of
the fragments extant. C. Fannius, prætor <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;C.</span> 617, wrote
a meager history<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c012'><sup>[348]</sup></a> in not inelegant Latin. Vennonius, his contemporary,
was the author of annals which are referred to by
Dionysius. To this list of historians may be added C. Sempronius
Tuditanus, a polished gentleman as well as an elegant writer.<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c012'><sup>[349]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The days of the Gracchi were very fruitful in historians and
autobiographers. At the head of them stands L. Cælius Antipater,<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c012'><sup>[350]</sup></a>
a Roman freedman, an eloquent orator, and skilful jurist.
His work consisted of seven books, and many fragments are
preserved by the grammarians. He seems to have delighted in
the marvellous; for Cicero quotes from two remarkable dreams
in his treatise on divination. He is also frequently referred to
by Livy in his history of the Punic wars.</p>

<p class='c011'>Contemporaneously with Cælius lived Cn. Gellius, whose voluminous
history extended to the length of ninety-seven books
at least. Livy seldom refers to him. Probably, in this instance,
he acted wisely; for he seems to have been an historian of little
or no authority. Two other Gellii, Sextus and Aulus, flourished
at the same time.</p>

<p class='c011'>Publius Sempronius Asellio wrote, about the middle of the
seventh century of Rome, a memoir of the Numantian war. He
was an eye-witness of the scenes which he describes, for he was
tribune at Numantia under Scipio Africanus.<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c012'><sup>[351]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The only constitutional history of Rome was the work of C.
Junius, who was surnamed Gracchanus, in consequence of his
intimacy with C. Gracchus. It is certain that this work must
have been the result of original research, as there are no remains
extant of any history which could have furnished the materials.
The legal and political knowledge which it contained was evidently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>considerable, for it is quoted by the jurists as a trustworthy
authority.<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c012'><sup>[352]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Servius Fabius Pictor<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c012'><sup>[353]</sup></a> wrote annals; but his principal work
was a treatise on the pontifical law, an antiquarian record of
rites and ceremonies. L. Calpurnius Piso Frugi Censorius was
consul in the year in which Ti. Sempronius Gracchus was killed,
and censor the year after the murder of C. Gracchus:<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c012'><sup>[354]</sup></a> he is
occasionally quoted by Dionysius, and twice by Livy, who, on the
points in question, consider his authority less trustworthy than
that of Fabius Pictor.<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c012'><sup>[355]</sup></a> Gellius<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c012'><sup>[356]</sup></a> quotes from him the following
traditional anecdote of Romulus. Once upon a time the king
was invited out to supper. He drank very little, because he
had business to transact on the following day. Some one at
table remarked, if every body did so, wine would be cheaper.
“Nay,” replied Romulus, “I have drank as much as I wished;
if every body did so, it would be dear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Piso was an honest man, but not an honest historian. He
acquired the surname Frugi by his strict integrity and simple
habits; but his ingenuity tempted him to disregard historical
truth. Niebuhr considers him the first who introduced systematic
forgeries into Roman history. Seeing the discrepancies
and consistencies between the accounts given by previous annalists,
instead of weighing them together, and adopting those
which were best supported by the testimony of antiquity, he
either invented theories, in order to reconcile conflicting statements,
or substituted some narrative which he thought might
have been the groundwork of the marvellous legend. Niebuhr
observes, that he treated history precisely in the same way in
which the rationalists endeavoured to divest the scripture of its
miraculous character.</p>

<p class='c011'>M. Æmilius Scaurus, P. Rutilius Rufus, and Q. Lutatius Catulus,
were the first Roman autobiographers; and their example
was afterwards followed by Sulla, who employed his retirement
in writing his own memoir in twenty-two books. Scaurus was
the son of a charcoal-dealer, who, by his military talents, twice
raised himself to the consulship, and once enjoyed the honour of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>a triumph. A few unimportant fragments of his personal memoirs
are preserved by the grammarians. Rutilius was consul
<span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;C.</span> 649: he wrote his own life in Latin, and a history of
Rome in Greek.<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c012'><sup>[357]</sup></a> Catulus is praised by Cicero for his Latinity,
who compares his style to that of Xenophon.<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c012'><sup>[358]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The other historians, who flourished immediately before the
literary period of Cicero, were C. Licinius Macer, Q. Claudius
Quadrigarius, and Q. Valerius Antias.</p>

<p class='c011'>Macer<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c012'><sup>[359]</sup></a> was a prolix and gossiping writer: he was not deficient
in industry; he spared no pains in collecting traditions; but he
had no judgment in selection, and accepted all the Greek fables
respecting Italy without discrimination. Hence he makes some
statements which were rejected by annalists of greater authority.
Niebuhr<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c012'><sup>[360]</sup></a> defends him, and regrets deeply the loss of his annals.
He thinks it not improbable that Cicero’s unfavourable criticism
may have been owing to political prejudice. His work was voluminous,
and probably traced the Roman history from the
commencement to his own times.</p>

<p class='c011'>Quadrigarius is much quoted both by Livy and the grammarians.
From the fragments extant it is clear that his history commenced
with the Gallic wars; and from a passage in Plutarch’s Life
of Numa,<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c012'><sup>[361]</sup></a> he appears to have been actuated by a motive indicative
of his truthfulness as an historian. He was not content with
fabulous legends; and there were no documents in existence anterior
to the capture of Rome by the Gauls. His work consisted
of twenty-three books: it carried the history, as is generally
supposed, as far as the death of Sulla,<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c012'><sup>[362]</sup></a> or, as Niebuhr believed,
down to the consulship of Cicero.<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c012'><sup>[363]</sup></a> The longest fragment extant
has been preserved by Gellius, and relates the combat of Manlius
Torquatus with the gigantic Gaul.</p>

<p class='c011'>The style is abrupt and sententious, and the structure of the
sentences loose; but the story is told in a naïve and spirited
manner. One can realize the scene as the historian describes it—the
awe of the Roman host at the unwonted sight—the gigantic
stature, the truculent countenance of the Goliath-like youth—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>unbroken silence, in the midst of which his voice of thunder
uttered his defiance—the scorn with which he sneered and put
out his tongue when no one accepted his challenge—the shame
and grief of the noble Manlius—the struggle—the cutting off
the monster’s head, and the wreathing his own neck with the
collar still reeking with blood.</p>

<p class='c011'>It has been suggested that this historian received the surname
Quadrigarius because, in the games of the circus, celebrated after
the victory of Sulla, he won the prize in the chariot-race.</p>

<p class='c011'>No Roman historian ever made greater pretensions to accuracy
than Valerius Antias, and no one was less trustworthy. Livy,
on one occasion,<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c012'><sup>[364]</sup></a> accuses him of either negligence or impudent
exaggeration; but there is no doubt that he was guilty of the
latter fault. Almost all the places in which he is quoted by Livy
have reference to numbers, and in all he not only goes far beyond
all other historians,<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c012'><sup>[365]</sup></a> but even transgresses the bounds of possibility.
Livy never hesitates to call him a liar. In all cases he
is guilty of falsehood; the only question is whether his falsehood
is more or less moderate. The following examples are sufficient
to convict him. He undertakes to assert that the exact number
of the Sabine virgins was 527.<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c012'><sup>[366]</sup></a> If one historian states that 60
engines of war were taken, he makes the number 6,000;<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c012'><sup>[367]</sup></a> when
all authors, Greek and Latin, unite in asserting that in <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;C.</span>
553, there was no memorable campaign, he says a battle was
fought in which 12,000 of the enemy were slain and 1,200 taken
prisoners.<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c012'><sup>[368]</sup></a> In another place 10,000 slain become 40,000;<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c012'><sup>[369]</sup></a> and
a fine which Quadrigarius states was to be paid by instalments
in thirty years, he distributes only over the space of ten.<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c012'><sup>[370]</sup></a> With
matter of this unauthentic kind, he filled no less than seventy-five
books, of which a large portion of passages have been preserved,
especially by Livy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hitherto, with one doubtful exception, Latin historical composition
was in the hands of the great and noble; the first historian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>belonging to the order of the libertinei was L. Otacilius
Pilitus. Suetonius<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c012'><sup>[371]</sup></a> says, that he was not only originally a slave,
but that he acted as porter, and, as was the custom, was chained
to his master’s door. Nothing is known of his works; it is probable,
therefore, that they were of no merit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two more important names remain to be mentioned amongst
the annalists of this period—L. Cornelius Sisenna and Q. Ælius
Tubero. Sisenna, according to the testimony of Cicero,<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c012'><sup>[372]</sup></a> was
born between <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 640 and <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 680, and filled the office of
quæstor <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 676. He was, according to the same authority, a
man of learning and taste, wrote pure Latin, was well acquainted
with public business, and, although deficient in industry, surpassed
all his predecessors and contemporaries in his talents as
an historian. Probably his style of writing approached more
nearly to that of the new school, although still below the Ciceronian
standard. The testimony of Sallust is not so favourable,
as he considers him not sufficiently impartial to fulfil adequately
the duties of a contemporary historian.<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c012'><sup>[373]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>No fragments are extant of sufficient length to enable us to
form any estimate of his merits, although, on account of the
numerous unusual words which occur in his writings, no historian
of this period has been more frequently quoted by the grammarians.
The probability is that his twenty-three books are of
little or no value, as they are never referred to in order to illustrate
matters of historical or antiquarian interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tubero was the contemporary of Cicero, and did not write his
annals until after Cicero’s consulship. Nevertheless he must be
considered as belonging to the old school, and its last as well as
one of its most worthy representatives. He was the father of
L. Tubero, the legate of Q. Cicero, in Asia. Like Piso, he was a
stout opponent of the Gracchic policy, and a firm supporter of
the aristocracy. A stoic in philosophy, his life was in strict
accordance with his creed, and his style of writing is said to
have been marked with Catonian rudeness. He describes, in his
history, the cruel tortures of Regulus by the Carthaginians, and
relates the story of the wonderful serpent at Bagrada.<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c012'><sup>[374]</sup></a> He is
once quoted by Dionysius and twice by Livy.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Eloquence, though of a rude, unpolished kind, must have been
in the very earliest times a characteristic of the Roman people.
It is a plant indigenous to a free soil. Its infancy was nurtured
in the schools of Tisias and Corax, when, on the dethronement
of the tyrants, the dawn of freedom brightened upon Sicily; and,
just as in modern times it has flourished, especially in England
and America, fostered by the unfettered freedom of debate, so
it found a congenial home in free Greece and republican Rome.
He who could contrast in the most glowing colours the cruelty
of the pitiless creditor, with the sufferings of the ruined debtor—who
could ingeniously connect those patent evils with some defects
in the constitution, some inequalities in political rights hitherto
hidden and unobserved—would wield at will the affections
of the people, and become the master-spirit amongst his
fellow-citizens.</p>

<p class='c011'>Occasions would not be wanting in a state where, from the
earliest times, a struggle was continually maintained between a
dominant and a subject race, for the use of those arts of eloquence
which nature, the mistress of all art, suggests. The plebeians,
in their conflicts with the patricians, must have had some leader,
and eloquence, probably to a great extent, directed the selection,
even though there was, in reality, no Menenius Agrippa to lead
them back from the sacred mountain with his homely wisdom.
Cases of oppression, doubtless, inspired some Icilius or Virginius
with words of burning indignation, and many a Siccius Dentatus,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>though he had never learnt technical rhetoric, used the rhetorical
artifice of appealing to his honourable wounds and scars in front,
which he had received in the service of his country, and to disgraceful
weals with which his back was lacerated by the lash of
the torturer. In an army where the personal influence of the
general was more productive of heroism than the rules of a long-established
discipline, a short harangue often led the soldiers to
victory. And, lastly, the relation subsisting between the two
orders of patron and client taught a milder and more business-like
eloquence—that of explaining with facility common civil
rights, and unravelling the knotty points of the constitutional
law. Oratory, in fact, was the unwritten literature of active life,
and recommended itself by its antagonistic spirit and its utility
to a warlike and utilitarian people. Long, therefore, before the
art of the historian was sufficiently advanced to record a speech,
or to insert a fictitious one, as an embellishment or illustration
of its pages, the forum, senate, the battle-field, the threshold
of the jurisconsult, had been nurseries of Roman eloquence, or
schools in which oratory attained a vigorous youth, and prepared
for its subsequent maturity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tradition speaks of a speech recorded even before the poetry
of Nævius was written, and this speech was known to Cicero.
It was delivered against Pyrrhus by Appius Claudius the blind.<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c012'><sup>[375]</sup></a>
He belonged to a house, every member of which, from the decemvir
to the emperor, was born to bow down their fellow-men
beneath their strong wills. Such a character, united with a
poetical genius, implies the very elements of that oratory which
would curb a nation accustomed to be restrained by force as
much as by reason. On this celebrated occasion,<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c012'><sup>[376]</sup></a> the blind old
man caused himself to be borne into the senate-house on a litter,
that he might confront the wily Cineas whom Pyrrhus had sent
to negotiate peace. The Macedonian minister was an accomplished
speaker, and his memory, that important auxiliary to
eloquence, was so powerful, that in one day he learnt to address
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>all the senators and knights by name, yet it is said that he was
no match for the energy of Appius, and was obliged to quit Rome.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whilst the legal and political constitution of the Roman people
gave direct encouragement to deliberative and judicial oratory,
respect to the illustrious dead furnished opportunities for panegyric.
The song of the bard in honour of the departed warrior
gave place to the funeral oration, (<i>laudatio</i>.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Before the commencement of the second Punic war,<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c012'><sup>[377]</sup></a> Q. Metellus
pronounced the funeral harangue over his father, the conqueror
of Hasdrubal; history also speaks of him as a debator in
the senate, and his address to the censors is found in the fourth
decade of Livy.<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c012'><sup>[378]</sup></a> This funeral oration was admired even in the
time of J. Cæsar, and Pliny<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c012'><sup>[379]</sup></a> has recorded the substance of one
remarkable passage which it contained. The period of the second
Punic war produced Corn. Cethegus. Cicero mentions him
in his list of Roman orators;<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c012'><sup>[380]</sup></a> and although he had never seen a
specimen of his style, he states that he retained his force and
vigour even in his old age. Ennius also bears testimony to his
eloquence in the following line:—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Flos delibatus populi, suaviloquenti ore.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>At the conclusion of the second war, Fabius Cunctator pronounced
the eulogium<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c012'><sup>[381]</sup></a> of his elder son; and Cicero, although he
denies him the praise of eloquence, states that he was a fluent
and correct speaker.</p>

<p class='c011'>Scipio Africanus Major, on that memorable day when his enemies
called upon him to render an account of the moneys received
from Antiochus, proved himself a consummate orator:
he disdained to refute the malignant charges of his opponents,
but spoke till dusk of the benefits which he had conferred upon
his country. Thus it came to pass that the adjourned meeting
was held on the anniversary of Zama. Livy has adorned the
simple words of the great soldier with his graceful language,
but A. Gellius<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c012'><sup>[382]</sup></a> has preserved the peroration almost in his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>words. “I call to remembrance, Romans,” said he, “that this
is the very day on which I vanquished in a bloody battle on the
plains of Africa the Carthaginian Hannibal, the most formidable
enemy Rome ever encountered. I obtained for you a peace and
an unlooked-for victory. Let us then not be ungrateful to heaven,
but let us leave this knave, and at once offer our grateful
thanksgivings to Jove, supremely good and great.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The people obeyed his summons—the forum was deserted,
and crowds followed him with acclamations to the Capitol.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mention has already been made of the stern eloquence of his
adversary Cato. He was equally laborious as a speaker and a
writer. No fewer than one hundred and fifty of his orations
were extant in Cicero’s time, most of which were on subjects of
public and political interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>The father of the Gracchi was distinguished amongst his contemporaries
for a plain and nervous eloquence, but no specimens
of his oratory have survived.</p>

<p class='c011'>Scipio Africanus Minor (Æmilianus) was precisely qualified
to be the link between the new and the old school of oratory.
His soldier-like character displayed all the vigour and somewhat
of the sternness of the old Roman, but the harder outlines were
modified by an ardent love of learning. His first campaign was
in Greece, under his father Æmilius Paulus. His first literary
friendship was formed there with the historian Polybius, which
ripened into the closest intimacy when Polybius came as a hostage
to Rome. Subsequently he became acquainted with Panætius,
who was his instructor in the principles of philosophy. His taste
was gratified with Greek refinement, although he abhorred the
effeminacy and profligacy of the Greeks themselves. In the spirit
of Cato, for whom he entertained the warmest admiration, he
indignantly remonstrated against the inroad of Greek manners.
In his speech in opposition to the law of C. Gracchus, he warned
his hearers of the corruptions which were already insinuating
themselves amongst the Roman youth. “I did not believe what
I heard,” he says, “until I witnessed it with my own eyes: at the
dancing-school I saw more than five hundred of the youth of
both sexes. I saw a boy, of at least twelve years old, wearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>the badge of noble birth, who performed a castanet dance, which
an immodest slave could not have danced without disgrace.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The degeneracy of Greek manners had not corrupted his
moral nature, or rendered him averse to the active duties of a
citizen; it had not destroyed the frankness, whilst it had humanized
the rough honesty, of the Roman, and taught him to love
the beautiful as well as the good, and to believe that the former
was the proper external development of the latter.</p>

<p class='c011'>One friend, whose influence contributed to form the mind of
Scipio, was the wise and gentle Lælius. In other places, as well
as in the “<i>de Amicitia</i>,” Cicero associates their names together.
These distinguished friends were well suited to each other. The
sentiments of both were noble and elevated. “Both,” as Cicero<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c012'><sup>[383]</sup></a>
says, “were ‘<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">imprimis eloquentes</span></i>.’” Their discrepancies were
such as draw men of similar tastes more closely together, in those
hours which they can devote to their favourite pursuits. Scipio
was an active man of business—Lælius, a contemplative philosopher:
Scipio, a Roman in heart and soul—Lælius, a citizen of
the world: Scipio was rather inclined to ostentatious display—Lælius
was retiring. The former had a correct taste, spoke
Latin with great purity, and had an extensive acquaintance with
the literature both of Greece and his own country. The attainments
of the latter were more solid, and his acquaintance with
the mind of Greece more profound. But Lælius was not equally
calculated to occupy a place in history; and hence, perhaps, although
a few fragments of the eloquence of Scipio are extant,<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c012'><sup>[384]</sup></a>
the remains of that of Lælius extend only to as many lines.
Cheerfulness, (hilaritas,) smoothness, (lenitas,) and learning distinguished
the speeches of Lælius, whilst spirit, genius, and natural
power marked those of Scipio.</p>

<p class='c011'>Servius Sulpicius Galba, whom Cato<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c012'><sup>[385]</sup></a> prosecuted for his treachery
to the Lusitanians, obtained from Cicero the praise of having
been the first Roman who really understood how to apply the
theoretical principles of Greek rhetoric. He is said likewise to
have carried away with him the feelings of his auditors by his
animated and vehement delivery. How skilful he was in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>use of rhetorical artifice is shown by his parading before the
assembly of the people, when brought to trial, his two infant
sons, and the orphan of his friend Sulpicius Gallus. His tears
and embraces touched the hearts of his judges, and the cold-blooded
perjurer was acquitted. External artifice, however,
probably constituted his whole merit. He had the tact thus to
cover a dry and antique style, destitute of nerve and muscle, of
which no specimen except only a few words remain.</p>

<p class='c011'>All periods of political disquiet are necessarily favourable to
eloquence, and the era of the Gracchi was especially so. Extensive
political changes were now established. They had been of
slow and gradual growth, and were the natural development of
the Roman system; but they were changes which could not take
place without the crisis being accompanied by great political
convulsions. In order to understand the state of parties, of
which the great leaders and principal orators were the representatives,
it is necessary to explain briefly in what these changes
consisted. The result of an obstinate and persevering struggle
during nearly four centuries was, that the old distinction of patrician
and plebeian no longer existed. Plebeians held the consulship<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c012'><sup>[386]</sup></a>
and censorship,<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c012'><sup>[387]</sup></a> and patricians, like the Gracchi, stood
forward as plebeian tribunes and champions of popular rights.</p>

<p class='c011'>The distinctions of blood and race, therefore, were no longer
regarded. Most of the old patrician families were extinct.
Niebuhr believes that at this period not more than fifteen patrician
“<i>gentes</i>” remained; and the individual members of those
which survived, if they maintained their position at all, maintained
it by personal influence. The constitutional principle
which determined the difference of ranks was property. This
line of demarkation between rich and poor was not an impassable
one like that of birth, but it had now become very broad and
deep, owing to the accumulation of wealth in few hands; and
thus between these two orders there was as little sympathy as
there had been between the patrician creditors and the plebeian
debtors in the earlier times of the republic.</p>

<p class='c011'>But besides this constitutional principle of distinction, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>was another of a more aristocratic nature, which owed its erection
to public opinion. Those families the members of which
had held high public offices were termed <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nobiles</span></i> (nobles.) Those
individuals whose families had never been so distinguished were
termed new men (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">novi homines</span></i>.) Thus a man’s ancestors were
made hostages for his patriotism; and so trustworthy a pledge
was hereditary merit considered for ability and fidelity in the
discharge of high functions, that only in a few exceptional cases
was the consulship, although open to all, conferred upon a new
man. One consequence of all these changes was, that the struggle
for political distinction became hotter than ever, and the strife
more vehement between the competitors for public favour.</p>

<p class='c011'>These stirring times produced many celebrated orators. Papirius
Carbo, the ultra-liberal and unscrupulous colleague of
Tiberius Gracchus, who united the gift of a beautiful voice to
copiousness and fluency; Lepidus Porcina, who attained the
perfection of Attic gentleness, and whom Tib. Gracchus took as
his model; Æmilius Scaurus, whom Statius libelled as of ignoble
birth; Rutilius Rufus, who was too upright to appeal to the
compassion of his judges;<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c012'><sup>[388]</sup></a> M. Junius Pennus, who met by an insulting
alien act the bill of Gracchus for the enfranchisement of
the Italians.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Gracchi themselves were each in a different degree eloquent,
and possessed those endowments and accidents of birth
which would recommend their eloquence to their countrymen.
Gentleness and kindness were the characteristics of this illustrious
race. Their father, by his mild administration, attached
to himself the warm affection of the Spaniards. Their mother
inherited the strong mind and genius of Scipio. To a sound
knowledge of Greek and Latin literature<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c012'><sup>[389]</sup></a> and a talent for poetry,
she added feminine accomplishments. She danced elegantly,
more elegantly, indeed, than according to the strict notions of
Roman morality a woman of character need have done. She
could also sing and accompany herself upon the lute. To her
care in early youth the illustrious brothers owed the development
of their natural endowments, and the direction of their generous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>principles. Cicero tells us that he had seen the letters of this
remarkable woman, which showed how much her sons were indebted
to her teaching. Greek philosophers aided her in her
work; and the accomplished Lælius contributed to add grace
and polish to the more solid portions of her education.</p>

<p class='c011'>Notwithstanding that the political principles which the Gracchi
embraced were the same, their characters, or, more properly
speaking, their temperaments, widely differed, and their style
of speaking was, as might be expected, in accordance with their
respective dispositions. Tiberius was cold, deliberate, sedate,
reserved. The storms of passion never ruffled the calmness of
his feelings. His speaking, therefore, was self-possessed and
grave, as stoical as his philosophical creed. His conduct was
not the result of impulse, but of a strict sense of duty. Cicero
termed him <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">homo sanctissimus</span></i>, and his style was as chastened
as his integrity was spotless. Such, if we may trust Plutarch,
was the character of his oratory, for no fragments remain.</p>

<p class='c011'>Caius, who was nine years younger than his brother, was warm,
passionate, and impetuous: he was inferior to Tiberius morally,
as he was intellectually his superior. His impulses were generous
and amiable, but he had not that unswerving rectitude of
purpose which is the result of moral principle. He had, however,
more genius, more creative power. His imagination, lashed by
the violence of his passions, required a strong curb; but for
that reason it gushed forth as from a natural fountain, and like
a torrent carried all before it. On one occasion, to which Cicero
alludes,<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c012'><sup>[390]</sup></a> his look, his voice, his gestures, were so inexpressibly
affecting, that even his enemies were dissolved in tears. It is
said that in his calmer moments he was conscious that his vehemence
was apt to offend against good taste, and employed a slave
to stand near him with a pitch-pipe, in order that he might
regulate his voice when passion rendered the tones unmusical.
His education enabled him to rid himself of the harshness of
the old school, and to gain the reputation of being the father
of Roman prose. But his impetuosity made him leave unfinished
that which he had well begun. “His language was noble, his
sentiments wise; gravity pervaded his whole style, but his works
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>wanted the last finishing stroke. There were many glorious beginnings,
but they were not brought to perfection.”<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c012'><sup>[391]</sup></a> Several
fragments remain, which confirm the correctness of Cicero’s criticism—one
of the most beautiful is from his speech against
Popilius Lænas, which drove that blood-thirsty tyrant into voluntary
exile.</p>

<p class='c011'>Oratory began now to be studied more as an art, and to be
invested with a more polished garb. The interval between the
Gracchi and Cicero boasted of many distinguished names, such
as those of Q. Catulus, Curio, Fimbria, Scævola, Cotta, P. Sulpicius,
and the Memmii. The most illustrious names of this epoch
were M. Antonius, L. Licinius Crassus, and Cicero’s immediate
predecessor and most formidable rival, Hortensius. Antony and
Crassus, says Cicero, were the first Romans who elevated eloquence
to the heights to which it had been raised by Greek
genius.<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c012'><sup>[392]</sup></a> From this complaint it may be inferred that, notwithstanding
the popular prejudice which existed against Greek
taste, and to which even Cicero himself sometimes conceived
himself obliged to yield,<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c012'><sup>[393]</sup></a> the leading orators had ceased to take
the specimens of old Roman eloquence as their models. Cicero
asserts<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c012'><sup>[394]</sup></a> that both Antony and Crassus owed their eminence to
a diligent study of Greek literature, and to the instructions of
Greek professors. The former, he says, attended regularly lectures
at Athens and Rhodes, and the latter spoke Greek as if it
had been his mother tongue. Yet both had the narrow-minded
vanity to deny their obligations: they thought their eloquence
would be more popular, the one by showing contempt for the
Greeks, the other by affecting not to know them.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>M. Antonius.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>M. Antonius entered public life as a pleader, and thus laid
the foundation of his brilliant political career; but he was
through life greater as a judicial than as a deliberative orator.
He was indefatigable in preparing his case, and made every
point tell: he was a great master of the pathetic, and knew the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>way to the hearts of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">judices</span></i>. He was not free from the
prevailing fault of advocates, of being somewhat unscrupulous
in his assertions; and the reason which he is said to have given
for never having published any of his speeches was, lest he should
be forced to deny his words. This statement, however, is refuted
by Cicero.<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c012'><sup>[395]</sup></a> Although he did not himself give his speeches
to posterity, some of his most pointed expressions and favourite
passages left an indelible impression on the memories of his
hearers: many are preserved by Cicero, who has given us also
a complete epitome of one of them.<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c012'><sup>[396]</sup></a> In the prime of life, he
fell a victim to political fury; and his bleeding head was placed
upon the rostrum which was so frequently the scene of his eloquent
triumphs.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>L. Licinius Crassus.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>L. Licinius Crassus was four years younger than Antonius,
having been born <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 140. It is not known whether he was
connected with the distinguished family whose name he bore.
He commenced his career at the Roman bar.<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c012'><sup>[397]</sup></a> At the early age
of twenty-one, he successfully impeached C. Carbo, and in the
year <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 118 supported the foundation of a colony at Narbo,
in Gaul. A measure so beneficial to the poorer citizens increased
his popularity as well as his professional fame. He went to Asia
as quæstor, and there studied under Metrodorus the rhetorician.
On his way home he remained a short time at Athens, and attended
the lectures of the leading professors.</p>

<p class='c011'>Notwithstanding his knowledge of jurisprudence, and his early
eminence as a pleader, the speech which established his reputation
was a political one. Under the Roman judicial system, the
prætor presided in court, with a certain number of assessors,
(judices,) who gave their verdict like our jurymen. These were
chosen from the senators. Experience proved that not only in
their determination to stand by their order they were guilty of
partiality, but that they had also been open to bribery. The
knights constituted the nearest approach which could be found
to a rich middle class. C. Gracchus, therefore, by the “<cite class='quote'>Lex
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Sempronia</cite>,” transferred the administration of justice to a body
of three hundred men, chosen from the equestrian order. This
promised to be a salutary change; but so corrupt was the whole
framework of Roman society, that it did not prove effectual.
The <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Publicani</span></i>, who farmed the revenues of the provinces, were
all Roman knights. The new judges, therefore, were as anxious
to shield the peculations and extortions of their own brethren as
the old had been.</p>

<p class='c011'>In <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 106, L. Servilius Cæpio brought in a bill for the
restoration of the judicial office to the senators. In support
of this measure (the first Lex Servilia,) Crassus delivered a
powerful and triumphant oration, in which he warmly espoused
the cause of the senate, whom he had before as strenuously opposed
on the question of the colony to Narbo. This speech
was his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d’œuvre</span></i>.<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c012'><sup>[398]</sup></a> After serving the office of consul,<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c012'><sup>[399]</sup></a> in
which he seems to have mistaken his vocation by exchanging
the toga for the sword, he was raised to the censorship.<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c012'><sup>[400]</sup></a> His
year of office is celebrated for the closing the schools of the
Latin rhetoricians by an edict of himself and his colleague.
The foundations of these schools had been laid in the ruins of
the Greek schools, when the philosophers and rhetoricians were
banished from Rome.<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c012'><sup>[401]</sup></a> Although the censorial power could
suppress the schools, it could not put a stop to the education
given there. The professors found a refuge in private mansions;
and thus, protected and fostered by intelligent patrons,
continued to fulfil their duties as instructors of youth. How
often did literature at Rome have to seek an asylum from private
patronage against the rude attacks of public prejudice!
The reasons for the measure of Crassus are stated in the preamble.<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c012'><sup>[402]</sup></a>
These schools were a novelty; they were contrary to
ancient institutions; they encouraged idle habits among the
Roman youth. Cicero defended this arbitrary act on the ground
that the professors pretended to teach subjects of which they
were themselves ignorant; but Cicero could scarcely find a
fault in Crassus. He thought him a model of perfection—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>first of orators and jurists.<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c012'><sup>[403]</sup></a> He saw no inconsistency in his
conduct in the cases of the Narbonne colony and the Servilian
law.<a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c012'><sup>[404]</sup></a> He is lavish in his praises of his wit and facetiousness,
(lepor et facetiæ,<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c012'><sup>[405]</sup></a>) and applies to his malignant and ill-natured
jokes the term urbanity. The bon-mots of Crassus were by no
means superior to the generality of Roman witticisms, which
were deficient in point, although they were personal, caustic,
and severe.<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c012'><sup>[406]</sup></a> The grave Romans were content with a very
little wit; the quality for which they looked in an oration was
not playfulness, but skill in the art of ingenious tormenting.
Crassus never uttered a jest equal to that of old Cato, when
he said of Q. Helvidius, the glutton, whose house was on fire,
“What he could not eat he has burned.”<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c012'><sup>[407]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>His conduct with respect to the Latin schools, and his self-indulgent
life in his magnificent mansion on the Palatine, prove
that he had retained the narrow-mindedness of the old Romans
without their temperance and self-denial, and had acquired the
luxury and taste of the Greeks without their liberality. If,
however, we make some allowance for partiality, Crassus deserves
the favourable criticism of Cicero.<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c012'><sup>[408]</sup></a> His style is careful and yet
not laboured—it is elegant, accurate, and perspicuous. He
seems to have possessed considerable powers of illustration, and
great clearness in explaining and defining; his delivery was calm
and self-possessed, his action sufficiently vehement, but not excessive.<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c012'><sup>[409]</sup></a>
He took especial pains with the commencement of his
speech. When he was about to speak, every one was prepared
to listen, and the very first words which he uttered showed him
worthy of the expectation formed. No one better understood
the difficult art of uniting elegance with brevity.</p>

<p class='c011'>From amongst the crowd of orators which were then flourishing
in the last days of expiring Roman liberty, Cicero selected
Crassus to be the representative of his sentiments in his imaginary
conversation in the <i>de Oratore</i>. He felt that their tastes
were congenial. In this most captivating essay, he introduces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>his readers to a distinguished literary circle, men who united
activity in public life with a taste for refined leisure. Antony,
Crassus, Scævola, Cotta, and Sulpicius, met at Tusculum to talk
of the politics of the day. For this especial purpose they had
come, and all day long they ceased not to converse on these
grave matters. They spoke not of lighter matters until they
reclined at supper. Their day seemed to have been spent in
the senate, their evening at Tusculum. Next day, in the serene
and sunny climate of Frascati, a scene well fitted for the calm
repose of a Platonic dialogue, Scævola proposed to imitate the
Socrates of Plato, and converse, as the great philosopher did,
beneath the shade of a plane-tree. Crassus assented, suggesting
only that cushions would be more convenient than the grass.
So the dialogue began in which Crassus is made the mouthpiece
to deliver the sentiments of Cicero.</p>

<p class='c011'>Like our own Chatham, Crassus almost died on the floor of
the senate-house, and his last effort was in support of the aristocratic
party. His opponent, Philippus the consul, strained
his power to the utmost to insult him, and ordered his goods to
be seized. His last words were worthy of him. He mourned
the bereavement of the senate—that the consul, like a sacrilegious
robber, should strip of its patrimony the very order of
which he ought to have been a kind parent or faithful guardian.
“It is useless,” he continued, “to seize these: if you will silence
Crassus, you must tear out his tongue, and even then my liberty
shall breathe forth a refutation of thy licentiousness!” The
paroxysm was too much for him; fever ensued, and in seven
days he was a corpse.</p>

<p class='c011'>We must pass over numerous names contained in the catalogue
of Cicero, mentioning by the way Cotta and the two Sulpicii.
Cotta’s taste was pure; but his delicate lungs made his
oratory too tame for his vehement countrymen. Publius Sulpicius
had all the powers of a tragic actor to influence the passions,
but professed that he could not write, and therefore left
no specimens behind him. His reluctance to write must have
been the result of reserve or of indolence, and not of inability,
for nothing can be more tender and touching, and yet more philosophical,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>than his letter to Cicero on the death of his beloved
daughter.<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c012'><sup>[410]</sup></a> Servius, like too many orators, and even Cicero
himself, at first despised an accurate knowledge of the Roman
law. The great Scævola, however, rebuked him, and reminded
him how disgraceful it was for one who desired the reputation
of an advocate to be ignorant of law. These words excited his
emulation; he ardently devoted himself to the study of jurisprudence,<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c012'><sup>[411]</sup></a>
and at length is said to have surpassed even Scævola
himself.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Q. Hortensius.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The last of the pre-Ciceronian orators was Hortensius. Although
he was scarcely eight years senior to the greatest of all
Roman orators, he cannot be considered as belonging to the
same literary period, since the genius and eloquence of Cicero
constitute the commencement of a new era. He was, nevertheless,
his contemporary and his rival; and all that is known respecting
his career is derived from the writings of Cicero.</p>

<p class='c011'>Q. Hortensius was the son of L. Hortensius, prætor of Sicily,
<span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 97. He was born <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 114; and, as it was the custom that
noble Roman youths should be called to the bar at an early
age, he commenced his career as a pleader at nineteen, and
pleaded, with applause and success, before two consuls who
were excellent judges of his merits, the orator Crassus and the
jurist Scævola. His first speech was in support of the province
of Africa against the extortions of the governor. In his second
he defended Nicomedes, king of Bithynia, against his brother,
who had dethroned him. When Crassus and Antony were dead,
he was left without any rival except Cotta, but he soon surpassed
him.<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c012'><sup>[412]</sup></a> The eloquence of Cotta was too languid to stand
against the impetuous flow, and he thus became the acknowledged
leader of the Roman bar until the star of Cicero arose. They
first came in contact when Cicero pleaded the cause of Quintius,
and in that oration he pays the highest possible compliment to
the talents and genius of Hortensius.</p>

<p class='c011'>His political connexion with the faction of Sulla, and his unscrupulous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>support of the profligate corruption which characterized
that administration both at home and abroad, enlisted
his legal talents in defence of the infamous Verres; but the
eloquence of Cicero, together with the justice of the cause
which he espoused, prevailed, and from that time forward his
superiority over Hortensius was established and complete. But
the admiration which Cicero entertained for his rival had ripened
into friendship, which neither the fact of their being retained
on opposite sides, nor even difference in politics, had power to
interrupt. The only danger which ever threatened its stability
was some little jealousy on the part of Cicero—a jealousy which
must be attributed to his morbid temperament and susceptible
disposition. But Hortensius was always a warm and affectionate
friend to Cicero, and Cicero was affected with the deepest
grief when he heard of the death of Hortensius.<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c012'><sup>[413]</sup></a> The time at
length arrived when identity of political sentiments drew them
more closely together; and it is to this we owe the place which
Hortensius so often occupies in the letters and other works of
the great Roman orator.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cicero had originally espoused the popular cause; but his zeal
gradually became less ardent, and the Catilinarian conspiracy
threw him entirely into the arms of the aristocratic party. At
the Roman bar politics had great influence in determining the
side taken by the leading advocates. They were virtually the
great law officers of the party in the republic to which they belonged,
and had, as it were, general retainers on their own side.
Hence Hortensius generally advocated the same side with
Cicero. Together they defended Rabirius, Muræna, Flaccus,
Sextius, Scaurus, and Milo; but the former seems to have at once
acknowledged his inferiority, and henceforward to have taken
but little part in public life. In <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 51, he defended his nephew
from a charge of bribery; but the guilt of the accused
was so plain that the people hissed him when he entered the
theatre.<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c012'><sup>[414]</sup></a> The following year he died, at the age of seventy-five,
and left behind him a daughter, whose eloquence is celebrated
in history. An oration, of which she was the author,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>was read in the time of Quintilian for the sake of its own merits,
and not as a mere compliment to the female sex. Q. Hortensius
has been accused of corruption; and his attachment to a corrupt
party, his luxurious habits, extravagant expenditure, numerous
villas, and enormous wealth, make it probable that this
suspicion was not unfounded. He was an easy, kind-hearted,
hospitable, but self-indulgent man. His park was a complete
menagerie; his fish-ponds were stocked with fish so tame that
they would feed from his hand. His gardens were so carefully
kept that he even watered his trees with wine. He had a taste
for both poetry and painting, wrote some amatory verses, and
for one picture gave 140,000 sesterces, (about 1,100<i>l.</i>) His
table was sumptuous; and peacocks were seen for the first time
in Rome at his banquets. His cellar was so well supplied that
he left 10,000 casks of Chian wine behind him.<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c012'><sup>[415]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Cicero<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c012'><sup>[416]</sup></a> tells us that the principal reason of Hortensius’ early
popularity and subsequent failure was, that his style of eloquence
was suited to the brilliance and liveliness of youth, but
not the dignity and gravity of mature age. In those days there
were two<a id='t202'></a> parties,<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c012'><sup>[417]</sup></a> who differed in their views as to the theory
of eloquence; the one admired the oratory of the Attic rhetoricians,
which was calm, polished, refined, eschewing all redundancies;
the other that of the Asiatic schools, which was florid
and ornate.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cicero<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c012'><sup>[418]</sup></a> tells us that the style of Hortensius’ eloquence was
Asiatic; and as the characteristic of his own eloquence is Asiatic
diffuseness rather than Attic closeness, and he often seems to
consider this quality of Asiatic eloquence least worthy of admiration,
it is possible that Hortensius carried it to excess, perhaps
even to the borders of affectation. In a youthful orator
excess of ornament is pardonable, because it is natural; it gives
promise of future excellence when genius becomes sobered and
luxuriance retrenched.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hortensius, a prosperous and spoilt child of nature, was a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>young man all his life: there was nothing to cast a gloom over
his gayety; and to those of his auditors who possessed good taste,
this juvenility seemed inconsistent, and threw into the shade
the finish, polish, and animation which characterized his style.
His delivery was probably no less unsuitable to more advanced
years. We are told that Æsop and Roscius used to study his
action as a lesson;<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c012'><sup>[419]</sup></a> and that one Torquatus sneeringly called him
Dionysius, who was a celebrated dancer of that day. His defence
was clever: “I had rather,” he said, “be that than a
clumsy Torquatus.” But these very anecdotes seem to imply
that his delivery was somewhat foppish and theatrical.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <span class='small'>STUDY OF JURISPRUDENCE—EARLIEST SYSTEMATIC WORKS ON ROMAN LAW—GROUNDWORK OF THE ROMAN CIVIL LAW—EMINENT JURISTS—THE SCÆVOLÆ—ÆLIUS GALLUS—C. AQUILIUS GALLUS, A LAW REFORMER—OTHER JURISTS—GRAMMARIANS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Politics and jurisprudence were the subjects on which the
Romans especially pursued independent lines of thought; but
their jurisprudence was the more original of the two. Although
the practical development of their political system was entirely
the work of this eminently practical people, still in the theory
of political science they were followers and imitators of the
Greeks. But in jurisprudence, the help which they derived from
Greece was very slight. The mere framework, so far as the
laws of the Twelve Tables are concerned, came to them from
Athens; but the complete structure was built up by their own
hands; and by their skill and prudence they were the authors
of a system possessing such stability, that they bequeathed it
as an inheritance to modern Europe, and traces of Roman law
are visible in the legal systems of the whole civilized world.</p>

<p class='c011'>Roman jurisprudence is, of course, a subject of too great extent
to be treated of as its importance deserves in a work like
the present; but still it is so closely connected with eloquence
that it cannot be dismissed without a few words. It has been
already stated that arms, politics, and the bar were the avenues
to distinction; and thus many an ambitious youth, who learned
the art of war in a foreign campaign under some experienced
general, occupied himself also at home in the forum. Not only
was the young patrician conscious that he could not efficiently
discharge his first duty to his clients without possessing sufficient
ability and knowledge to defend their rights in a court of law,
but this was an effectual method of showing his fitness for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>public career. Eminence as a jurisconsult opened a direct path
to eminence as a statesman.<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c012'><sup>[420]</sup></a> He must be like Pollio, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Insigne
mæstis præsidium reis</span></i>,” as well as “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Consulenti curiæ</span></i>.”<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c012'><sup>[421]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Hence the complicated principles of jurisprudence and of the
Roman constitution became a necessary part of a liberal education.
The brilliant orator, indeed, did sometimes affect to look
down with contempt on such black-letter and antiquarian lore,
and stigmatize it as pedantry;<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c012'><sup>[422]</sup></a> but still common sense compelled
the sober-minded to acknowledge the necessity of the study.
They saw that in the courts eloquence could only be considered
as the handmaid to legal knowledge, even though the saying of
Quintilian were true—“<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Et leges ipsæ nihil valent nisi actoris
idoneâ voce munitæ</span></i>.”<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c012'><sup>[423]</sup></a> When, therefore, a Roman youth had
completed his studies under his teacher of rhetoric, he not only
frequented the forum in order to learn the practical application
of the oratorical principles which he had acquired, and frequently
took some celebrated orator as a model, but also studied
the principles of jurisprudence under an eminent jurist, and attended
the consultations in which they gave to their clients
their expositions of law. In fact the young Roman acquired
his legal knowledge in the <i>atrium</i> of the jurisconsult, somewhat
in the same manner that the law student of the present day
pursues his education in the chambers of a barrister. He
studied the subject practically and empirically rather than in
its theory and general principles.</p>

<p class='c011'>Almost all the knowledge which we possess is derived from
the labours of writers who flourished long after constitutional
liberty had expired.</p>

<p class='c011'>The earliest systematic works on Roman law were the Enchiridion
or Manual of Pomponius, and the Institutes of Gaius, who
flourished in the times of Hadrian and the Antonines. Both these
works were for a long time lost, although numerous fragments
were preserved in the Pandects or Digest of Justinian. In 1816,
however, Niebuhr discovered a palimpsest MS., in which the
Epistles of St. Jerome were written over the erased Institutes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Gaius. But owing to the decisions and interpretations of the
great practising jurists, to the want of any system of reporting and
recording, and to the numerous misunderstandings of the Roman
historians respecting the laws and constitutional history of their
country, the whole subject long continued in a state of confusion:
new contradictory theories had been gradually introduced, and
old difficulties had not been explained and reconciled. Gian
Baptista Vico, in his <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scienza Nova</span></cite>, was the first who dispelled
the clouds of error and reduced it to a system; and his example
was afterwards so successfully followed by Niebuhr, that modern
students can understand the subject more clearly, and have a
more comprehensive antiquarian knowledge of it, than the writers
of the Augustan age.</p>

<p class='c011'>The earliest Roman laws were the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leges Regiæ</span></cite>, which were
collected and codified by Sextus Papirius, and were hence called
the Papirian Code. But these were rude and unconnected—simply
a collection of isolated enactments. The laws of the
Twelve Tables stand next in point of antiquity. They exhibited
the first attempts at regular system, and imbodied not only legislative
enactments but legal principles.<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c012'><sup>[424]</sup></a> So popular were they,
that when Cicero was a child every Roman boy committed them
to memory as our children learn their catechism,<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c012'><sup>[425]</sup></a> and the great
orator laments that in the course of his lifetime this practice had
become obsolete. The explanation of these laws was a privilege
confined to the pontifical college. This body alone prescribed
the form of pleading, and published the days on which the courts
were held. Hence, not only the whole practice and exposition
of the law was in the hands of the patricians, but they had also
the power of obstructing at their pleasure all legal business.
But in the censorship of Appius Claudius, his secretary, Cn.
Flavius, set up, at the suggestion of Appius, a Calendar in the
Forum, which made known to the public the days on which legal
business could be transacted. In vain the patricians endeavoured
to maintain their monopoly by the invention of new formulæ,
called Notes, for Tiberius Coruncanius, the first plebeian Pontifex
Maximus, who was consul <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;C.</span> 474, opened a public school
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>of jurisprudence, and in the middle of the next century<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c012'><sup>[426]</sup></a> the
“<cite class='quote'>Notes</cite>” were published by Sextus Ælius Catus.</p>

<p class='c011'>The oral traditional expositions of these laws formed the
groundwork of the Roman civil law. To these were added from
time to time the decrees of the people (plebiscita,) the acts of
the senate (senatus-consulta,) and the prætorian edicts, which
announced the principles on which each successive prætor purposed
to administer the statute law.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such were the various elements out of which the whole body
of Roman law was composed; and in such early times was the
subject diligently studied and expounded that the latter half
of the sixth century <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;C.</span> was rich in jurists whose powers
are celebrated in history. Besides S. Ælius Catus, already
mentioned, P. Licinius Crassus, surnamed “the rich,” who was
consul <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;C.</span> 549, is mentioned by Livy<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c012'><sup>[427]</sup></a> as learned in the pontifical
law, the canon law of the ancient Romans. L. Acilius
also wrote commentaries on the laws of the Twelve Tables; and
to these may be added T. Manlius Torquatus, consul <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;C.</span> 589,
S. Fabius Pictor, and another member of the same distinguished
family, Q. Fabius Labeo, Cato the censor and his son Porcius
Cato Licinianus, and lastly P. Cornelius Nasica, whose services
as a jurist were recognised by the grant of a house at the public
expense.</p>

<p class='c011'>The most eminent jurists who adorned the next century were
the Scævolæ. In their family the profession of the jurisconsult
seems to have been hereditary; of so many bearing that distinguished
name, it might have been said that their house was the
oracle of the whole state; “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Domus jurisconsulti totius oraculum
civitatis</span>.”<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c012'><sup>[428]</sup></a> Quintus, the augur, was Cicero’s first instructor in the
science of the law: his cousin Publius enjoyed also a high reputation;
and Quintus, the son of Publius, who became Cicero’s
tutor after the death of his elder kinsman, combined the genius
of an orator with the erudition of a jurist, and was called by his
distinguished pupil “the greatest orator among jurists, and the
greatest jurist among orators.” The compiler of the digest also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>quotes as authorities M. Manilius and M. Junius Brutus.<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c012'><sup>[429]</sup></a> Manilius
is one of the characters introduced in Cicero’s dialogue <i>de
Republica</i>: he was consul <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;C.</span> 604, and is said to have been
the author of seven legal treatises; but of all these, except three,
Cicero denies the authority. Brutus was the son of the ambassador
of that name who was employed in the war with Perseus,
and left a treatise in three books on the civil law.<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c012'><sup>[430]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>In the next century flourished one Ælius Gallus, who was
somewhat senior to Cicero, and was the author of a treatise on
the signification of law terms. Several of his definitions are
given by Festus, and fragments are preserved by A. Gellius,<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c012'><sup>[431]</sup></a>
and in the Digest. By some he has been considered identical
with Ælius Gallus, the prefect of Egypt in the reign of Augustus,<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c012'><sup>[432]</sup></a>
who was the friend of the geographer Strabo; but as there is
little doubt that he is quoted by Varro,<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c012'><sup>[433]</sup></a> such identity is impossible,
since Varro died <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 28, and yet he speaks of Gallus as an
aged man. Another distinguished jurist of this era was his namesake
C. Aquilius Gallus. He was a pupil of Q. Mucius Scævola,
and surpassed all his contemporaries in that black-letter knowledge
of law, which in olden time was more highly valued than
in the more brilliant days of Cicero. Learning then began to
be ridiculed and lightly esteemed, and oratorical powers were
more admired in proportion as the Roman mind became more
alive to the refinements and beauties of language.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Gallus was most eminent as a law reformer. The written
law of Rome presented by its technicality the greatest impediments
to actions on the unwritten principle of common right
and equity. To obviate this he invented legal fictions, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i> formulæ
by which the effects of the statute could be annulled without
the necessity of abrogating the statute itself. His practice
must have been large, for Pliny mentions that he was the owner
of a splendid palace on the Viminal Hill.<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c012'><sup>[434]</sup></a> In <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 67, he served
the office of prætor together with Cicero, and both before and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>after that he frequently sat as one of the judices. Cicero pleaded
before him in the defence both of Cæcina and Cluentius.</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides Aquilius Gallus, three of the most distinguished jurists,
who were a few years senior to Cicero, owed their legal knowledge
to the instructions of Mucius Scævola. These were—C.
Juventius, Sextus Papirius, and L. Lucilius Balbus, the last of
whom is mentioned by Cicero,<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c012'><sup>[435]</sup></a> and his works are quoted by his
eminent pupil Sulpicius Rufus.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Grammarians.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Towards the conclusion of this literary period a great increase
took place in the numbers of those learned men whom the Romans
termed “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Litterati</span></i>,”<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c012'><sup>[436]</sup></a> but afterwards, following the custom
of the Greeks, Grammarians, (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Grammatici</span></i>.<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c012'><sup>[437]</sup></a>) To them literature
was under deep obligations. Although few of them were
authors, and all of them men of acquired learning rather than
of original genius, they exercised a powerful influence over the
public mind as professors, lecturers, critics, and school-masters.
By them the youths of the best families not only were imbued
with a taste for Greek philosophy and poetry, but also were
taught to appreciate the literature of their own country.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suetonius places at the head of the class Livius Andronicus
and Ennius; but their fame as poets eclipses their reputation as
mere critics and commentators.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first professed grammarian whom he mentions is Crates
Mallotes, who, between the first and second Punic wars, was
sent to Rome by Attalus. The unfortunate ambassador fell into
an open drain and broke his leg, and beguiled the tediousness
of his confinement by reading a course of philological lectures.
After him C. Octavius Lampadio edited the works of Nævius;
Q. Vargunteius those of Ennius; and Lælius, Archelaus, Vectius,
and Q. Philocomus read and explained to a circle of auditors the
Satires of Lucilius.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>Most of these grammarians were emancipated slaves: some
were Greeks, some barbarians. Sævius Nicanor and Aurelius
Opilius were freedmen: the latter had belonged to the household
of some Epicurean philosopher. Cornelius Epicadus was
a freedman of Sulla, and completed the Commentaries which
his patron left unfinished, and Lenæus was freedman of Pompey
the Great. M. Pompilius Andronicus was a Syrian; M. Antonius
Gnipho, though of ingenuous birth, a Gaul. Servius Clodius,
however, and L. Ælius Lanuvinus were Roman knights.
Nor were the labours of these industrious scholars confined to
Rome, or even to Italy; for Octavius Teucer, Siscennius Iacchus
and Oppius Chares gave instructions in the province of Gallia
Togata.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the names already mentioned may be added those of L.
Ælius Stilo, who accompanied L. Metellus Numidicus into exile,
and Valerius Cato, who not only taught the art of poetry, but
was himself a poet.</p>

<p class='c011'>We have now traced from its infancy the rise and progress of
Roman literature, and watched the gradual opening of the
national intellect. The dawn has gently broken, the light has
steadily increased, and is now succeeded by the noon-day brilliance
of the “golden age.”</p>

</div>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <span class='small'>PROSE THE TEST OF THE CONDITION OF A LANGUAGE—DRAMATIC LITERATURE EXTINCT—MIMES—DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ROMAN AND GREEK MIMES—LABERIUS—PASSAGES FROM HIS POETRY—MATIUS CALVENA—MIMIAMBI—PUBLIUS SYRUS—ROMAN PANTOMIME—ITS LICENTIOUSNESS—PRINCIPAL ACTORS OF PANTOMIME.</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>During the period upon which we are now entering, Roman
literature arrived at its greatest perfection. The time at which
it attained the highest point of excellence is fixed by Niebuhr<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c012'><sup>[438]</sup></a>
about <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;C.</span> 680, when Cicero was between thirty and forty
years old. Poetry, indeed, still continued to improve, as regarded
metrical structure and diction, in finish, smoothness, and
harmony. There is <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title='exempli gratia'>ex. gr.</abbr></span></i> in these respects a marked difference
between the works of Lucretius and Virgil; but nevertheless
the principles of language now became fixed and settled. In
fact, the condition of a language must be judged of by its prose;
so must likewise the state of perfection to which its literature
has attained. If poetry could be with propriety assumed as the
standard, the commencement of the empire of Augustus would
constitute the best age of Latin literature, rather than the time
when the forum echoed with the eloquence of Cicero; but in the
two ages of Cicero and Augustus, taken together as forming one
era, is comprehended the golden age both of poetry and prose.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dramatic literature, however, never recovered from the trance
into which it had fallen. The stage had not altogether lost that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>popularity which it had possessed in the days of Attius and Terence,
for Æsopus and Roscius, the former the great tragedian,
the latter the favourite comedian, in the time of Cicero, amassed
great wealth. Æsopus lived liberally,<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c012'><sup>[439]</sup></a> and yet bequeathed a
fortune to his son, and Roscius is said to have earned daily the
sum of thirty-two pounds.</p>

<p class='c011'>Notwithstanding, also, the degradation attached to the social
position of an actor, both these eminent artists enjoyed the
friendship of Cicero and other great men. They brought to the
study of their profession industry, taste, talent, and learning,
and these qualities were appreciated. Æsopus was on one occasion
encored a countless number of times (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">millies</span></i>)<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c012'><sup>[440]</sup></a> by an enthusiastic
audience, and Roscius was elevated by Sulla to the equestrian
dignity. But although the standard Roman plays were
constantly represented, dramatic literature had become extinct.
No one wrote comedy at all, and the tragedies of Valgius Rufus
and Asinius Pollio were only intended for reading or recitation.
Nor, as has been already shown, does the Thyestes of Varus
really form an exception to this statement.</p>

<p class='c011'>The dramatic entertainments which had now taken the place
of comedy and tragedy were termed mimes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their distinguishing appellation was derived from the Greek,
but they entirely differed from those compositions to which the
Greeks applied that title. The latter were written not in verse,
but in prose;<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c012'><sup>[441]</sup></a> they were dialogues, not dramatic pieces, and
though they were exhibited at certain festivals, and the parts
supported by actors, they were never represented on the stage.
Even when Sophron, whose compositions were admired and imitated
by Plato,<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c012'><sup>[442]</sup></a> raised them to their highest degree of perfection,
and made them vehicles of serious moral lessons mingling together
ludicrous buffoonery with grave philosophy, their language was
only a rhythmical prose, probably somewhat resembling that in
which the celebrated despatch of Hippocrates<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c012'><sup>[443]</sup></a> was written.
Some idea may be formed of their nature from the fact that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>idylls of Theocritus were imitated from the mimes of Sophron,
and that Persius took them for his model in his peculiarly dramatic
satires.<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c012'><sup>[444]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The Roman mimes were laughable imitations of manners and
persons. So far they combined features of comedy and farce;
for comedy represents the characters of a class—farce those of
individuals. Their essence was that of the modern pantomime;
mimicry and burlesque dialogue were only accidentally introduced.
Their coarseness and even indecency<a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c012'><sup>[445]</sup></a> gratified the love
of broad humour which characterized the Roman people. They
became successful rivals of comedy, and thus came to be admitted
on the public stage. It is most probable that like other dramatic
exhibitions, they originally grew out of the Fabulæ Atellanæ,
which they afterwards superseded. But notwithstanding their
indecency, their satire upon the living, and their burlesque representations
of the illustrious dead, when exhibited at funeral
games, they had sometimes, like the mimes of Sophron, a moral
character, and abounded in shrewd wisdom and noble sentiments.<a id='r446' /><a href='#f446' class='c012'><sup>[446]</sup></a>
Schlegel asserts that there is a great affinity between the Roman
mimes and the pasquinades and harlequinades of modern Italy.
He conjectures that in them may be traced the germ of the
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Comedie dell’ Arte</span></i>, and states that the very picture of Polichinello
is found in some of the frescoes of Pompeii.</p>

<p class='c011'>After a time, when mimes became established as popular favourites,
the dialogue or written part of the entertainment occupied
a more prominent position, and was written in verse, like
that of tragedy or comedy. In the dictatorship of Julius Cæsar,
a Roman knight, named Decius Laberius, became eminent for
his mimes. Respecting his merits, we have few opportunities
of forming a judgment, as the fragments of his writings<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c012'><sup>[447]</sup></a> are but
few and short; but Horace<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c012'><sup>[448]</sup></a> speaks of them in unfavourable language,
and finds fault with their carelessness and want of regular
plan. He was born about <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 107,<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c012'><sup>[449]</sup></a> and died <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 45, at Puteoli,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>(Pozzuoli.) The profession of an actor of mimes was infamous;
but Laberius was a writer, not an actor. It happened, however,
that P. Syrus, who had been first the slave, then the freedman
and pupil of Laberius, and lastly a professional actor, challenged
all his brethren to a trial of improvisatorial skill. Cæsar entreated
Laberius to enter the lists, and offered him five hundred
sestertia (about 4,000<i>l.</i>) Laberius did not submit to the degradation
for the sake of the money, but he was afraid to refuse.
The only method of retaliation in his power was sarcasm. His
part was that of a slave, and when his master scourged him, he
exclaimed, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Porro, Quirites, libertatem perdimus!</span>” His words
were received with a round of applause, and the audience fixed
their eyes on Cæsar. On another occasion his attack on the
Dictator was almost threatening:—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Necesse est multos timeat quem multi timent.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c022'>He appears to have been always quick and ready in repartee.
When, on being vanquished by his adversary Syrus, the Dictator
said to him with a sneer—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Favente tibi me victus es Laberi a Syro,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c022'>He replied with the following sad but true reflections:—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Non possunt primi esse omnes omni in tempore,</div>

      <div class='line'>Cecidi ego, cadet qui sequitur, laus est publica.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Cæsar, however, restored to him the rank and equestrian privileges
of which his act had deprived him; but still he could not
recover the respect of his countrymen. As he passed the orchestra
in his way to the stalls of the knights, Cicero cried out,
“If we were not so crowded, I would make room for you here.”
Laberius replied, alluding to Cicero’s lukewarmness as a political
partisan, “I am astonished that you should be crowded, as you
generally sit on two stools.” The calm and feeling rebuke with
which, in the prologue to his mime, he remonstrated against the
tyranny of Cæsar, is singularly spirited and beautiful:—</p>

<p class='c011'>Another poet of this age who composed mimes was C. Matius,
surnamed, from his baldness, Calvena. His mimes were termed
<i>Mimiambi</i>, because he wrote in the iambic measure,<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c012'><sup>[450]</sup></a> and he was
also a translator of the Iliad as well as the author of a work on
cookery. His principal merit is said to have been his skill in
enriching his native language by the introduction of new words.<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c012'><sup>[451]</sup></a>
He was somewhat younger than Laberius, and enjoyed the
friendship of the greatest amongst his contemporaries. His
intimacy with Julius Cæsar,<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c012'><sup>[452]</sup></a> to whom he was warmly attached,<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c012'><sup>[453]</sup></a>
and afterwards with Augustus,<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c012'><sup>[454]</sup></a> gave him great influence;<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c012'><sup>[455]</sup></a> but
he never took much part in the political strife which imbittered
his times, nor did he use his influence in order to procure his
own advancement.</p>

<p class='c011'>His retired habits and love of literary leisure saved him from
seeking his happiness in the excitements of ambition. Cicero,
who loved him dearly, often mentions him in his letters, and pays
a compliment<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c012'><sup>[456]</sup></a> to his learning and amiability. An interesting
letter of his, which is preserved in the collection of Cicero’s
epistles to his friends,<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c012'><sup>[457]</sup></a> shows that he possessed an accomplished
mind and an affectionate heart. It cannot be supposed, therefore,
that his <i>Mimiambi</i> were debased by the too common faults of
coarseness and immodesty.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Publius Syrus.</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Publius Syrus was, as his name implies, originally a Syrian
slave, and took his prænomen from the master who gave him
his freedom. All that is known respecting his life has already
been stated in the account of Laberius. The commendations
which his mimes received from the ancients, especially from
Cicero,<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c012'><sup>[458]</sup></a> Seneca,<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c012'><sup>[459]</sup></a> and Pliny,<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c012'><sup>[460]</sup></a> prove them to have been much
read and admired. The fragments which still remain are marked
by wit and neatness, and the shrewd wisdom of proverbial philosophy.
Tradition has also recorded a <i>bon-mot</i> of his, which is
as witty as it is severe. Seeing once an ill-tempered man, named
Mucius, in low spirits, he remarked, “Either some bad fortune
has happened to Mucius, or some good fortune to one of his
friends.” An accurate knowledge of human nature, exhibited
in pointed and terse language, most probably constituted the
charm of this species of scenic literature. The large collection
of his proverbial sayings, entitled <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">P. Syri Sententiæ</span></cite>, are by no
means all genuine; but the nucleus around which the collection
has grown by successive additions is undoubtedly his, and those
which are the work of after ages are formed after the model of
his apothegms.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Roman pantomime differed somewhat from the mime—it
was a ballet of action performed by a single dancer. It was
first introduced in its complete form in the reign of Augustus:
and Suidas,<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c012'><sup>[461]</sup></a> misquoting a passage from Zosimus,<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c012'><sup>[462]</sup></a> groundlessly
attributes the invention to the emperor himself. As the mime
bore some resemblance to the Atellan farces, so the pantomime
resembled the histrionic performances introduced by Livius Andronicus.
In both, the person who recited the words (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">canticum</span></i><a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c012'><sup>[463]</sup></a>)
was different from him who represented the characters. In the
pantomime, the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">canticum</span></i> was sung by a chorus arrayed at the
back of the stage. Until the times of the later emperors, when
vice was paraded with unblushing effrontery, women never acted
in pantomime; but the exhibition itself was sensual and licentious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>in its character,<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c012'><sup>[464]</sup></a> and the actors of it were deservedly deemed
infamous, and forbidden by Tiberius to hold any intercourse
with Romans of equestrian or senatorial dignity.<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c012'><sup>[465]</sup></a> Nero, however,
outraged public decency by himself appearing in pantomime.<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c012'><sup>[466]</sup></a>
Fortunate was it for the dignity of Rome that the face
of the emperor was concealed behind a mask which, unlike the
performers in the mimes, the pantomimic actors always wore.
The players not only exhibited the human figure in the most
graceful attitudes, but represented every passion and emotion
with such truth, that the spectators could without difficulty understand
the story. Sometimes the scenes represented were
founded upon the Greek tragic drama; but for its purifying
effect was substituted the awakening of licentious passions.</p>

<p class='c011'>These were the exhibitions which threw such discredit on the
stage—which called forth the well-deserved attacks of the early
Christian fathers, and caused them to declare that whoever attended
them was unworthy of the name of Christians. Had the
drama not been so abused, had it retained its original purity, and
carried out the object attributed to it by Aristotle, they would
have seen in it not a nursery of vice, but a school of virtue—not
only an innocent amusement, but a powerful engine to form the
taste, to improve the morals, and to purify the feelings of a
people.</p>

<p class='c011'>The principal actors of pantomime in the reign of Augustus
were Bathyllus, Hylas, and Pylades. In the reign of Nero the
art was practised by Latinus,<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c012'><sup>[467]</sup></a> and Paris, who taught the emperor
to dance, and subsequently was put to death by Nero when he
became his rival for popular applause.<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c012'><sup>[468]</sup></a> But those who attained
the highest degree of popularity were another Latinus, and another
Paris, who flourished in the reign of Domitian. Both have
been immortalized in the epigrams of Martial.<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c012'><sup>[469]</sup></a> To the former,
Martial attributes the power to fascinate such stern and rigid
moralists as resembled Cato, the Curii, and Fabricii. The epitaph
concludes with these lines:—</p>

</div>
<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Lucretius Carus</span> (<span class='fss'>BORN B. C.</span> 95.)</h4>

<p class='c018'>Lucretius Carus might claim a place amongst philosophers
as well as poets, for his poem marks an epoch both in poetry and
philosophy. But his philosophy is a mere reflexion from that
of Greece, whilst his poetry is bright with the rays of original
genius. A delineation, therefore, of his characteristics as a
writer of the imagination, will present the more accurate idea of
the place which he occupies amongst Roman authors. It was
no empty boast of his, that, as a poet, he deserved the praise of
originality—that he had opened a path through the territory of
the muse, untrodden before by poet’s foot—that he had drawn
from a virgin fountain, and culled fresh flowers whence the Muse
had never yet sought them to wreathe a garland for the poet’s
brow.<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c012'><sup>[470]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Few materials exist for the compilation of his biography.
From two passages<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c012'><sup>[471]</sup></a> in his work, in which he states that his
native language was Latin, it is clear that he was born within
the limits of Italy. The date of his birth is generally fixed
<span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 95.<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c012'><sup>[472]</sup></a> The prevalence of the Epicurean philosophy, and
the additional popularity with which his talents invested the
fashionable creed, combined to raise him to the equestrian dignity;
and, consistently with his cold and hopeless atheism—his
proud disbelief in a superintending Providence—he died by his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>own hand in the prime of life and in the forty-fourth year of
his age.<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c012'><sup>[473]</sup></a> The story that his work was written in the lucid intervals
of a madness produced by a love-potion, as well as his
residence at Athens for the purpose of study, rest upon no foundation.</p>

<p class='c011'>His poem <cite>On the Nature of Things</cite> is divided into six books,
and is written in imitation of that of Empedocles, who is the
subject of his warmest praise and admiration. Whilst its subject
is philosophical and its purpose didactic, its unity of design,
the one point of view from which he regards the various doctrines
of the master whose principles he adopts, claims for it the
rank of an epic poem.</p>

<p class='c011'>This epic structure prevents it from being a complete and
systematic survey of the whole Epicurean philosophy; but, notwithstanding
this deficiency in point of comprehensiveness, the
exactness and fidelity with which he represents those doctrines
which he enunciates, renders him deserving of the credit of
having given to his countrymen, as far as epic writing permitted,
an accurate view of the philosophical system which then enjoyed
the highest degree of popularity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although Greek philosophy furnished Lucretius with his subject,
and a Greek poem served as a model, he also saw and valued
the capabilities of the Latin language—he wielded at will
its power of embodying the noblest thoughts, and showed how
its copious and flexible properties could overcome the hard technicalities
of science. Grand as were his conceptions, the language
of Lucretius is not inferior to them in majesty. Without
violating philosophical accuracy, he never appears to feel it a
restraint to his muse: his fancy is always lively, his imagination
has free scope even when his thoughts are fixed in the abstrusest
theories, and engaged in the most subtle argumentation.<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c012'><sup>[474]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The great beauty of the poetry of Lucretius is its variety.
One might expect sublimity in the philosopher who penetrates
the secrets of the natural world, and discloses to the eye of man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>the hidden causes of its wonderful phenomena. His object was
a lofty one; for, although the irrational absurdities of the national
creed drove him into the opposite evils of skepticism and
unbelief, his aim was to set the intellect free from the trammels
of superstition. But besides grandeur and sublimity we find the
totally different poetical qualities of softness and tenderness.
Rome had long known nothing but war, and was now rent by
that worst and most demoralizing kind of war, civil dissension.
Lucretius yearned for peace; and his prayer, that the fabled
goddess of all that is beautiful in nature would heal the wounds
which discord had made, is distinguished by tenderness and
pathos even more than by sublimity. The whole passage is superior
to the poetry of Ovid in force, although inferior in facility.
His versification is not so smooth and harmonious as that of Virgil,
who flourished in a period when the language had attained a
higher degree of perfection, and the Roman ear was more educated,
and therefore more delicately attuned, but it is never
harsh and rugged, and always falls upon the ear with a swelling
and sonorous melody. Virgil appreciated his excellence, and
imitated not only single expressions, but almost entire verses
and passages.<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c012'><sup>[475]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>As an example of sublimity, few passages can equal that in
which he describes the prostration of human intellect under the
grievous superstition, the dauntless purpose of Epicurus to free
men from her oppressive rule, and to enable him to burst open
the portals of Nature’s treasure-house, and thus gain a victory
which will place him on an equality with the inhabitants of
heaven:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c018'>The idea which the poet here presents to the mind of his
readers is of the same kind with that which pervades the writings
of the Greek tragedians: it is that of the limited energies of
mortals resolutely struggling with a superior and almost irresistible
power.</p>

<p class='c011'>The thrilling narrative of the plague at Athens, with all its
physical and moral horrors, is one of the most heart-rending specimens
of descriptive poetry. The stern rejection of all fear of
death, though based upon a denial of the immortality of the
soul, is a noble burst of poetical as well as philosophical enthusiasm;
and the fifth book displays that perfect finish and accomplished
grace which characterizes all the best Roman poets.
Amongst the most affecting passages may be enumerated those
which describe the early sorrows of the human race, and the
grief of the bereaved animal whose young one has been slain in
sacrifice.<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c012'><sup>[476]</sup></a> Two other fine passages are the philosophical explanation
of Tartarus, and the panoramic view of the tempest of
human desires, seen from the rocky heights of philosophy—a glorious
descriptive piece which has been imitated by Lord Bacon.</p>

<p class='c011'>The following lines show how beautifully the poet has caught
the spirit and feeling of Greek fancy, and how capable the Latin
language now was of adequately expressing them:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>It cannot be denied that there are in the poem of Lucretius
many barren wastes over which are scattered the rubbish and
<i>débris</i> of a false philosophy; but even in these deserts the oases
are numerous enough to prevent exhaustion and fatigue. They
recur too frequently to enumerate them all. If the attempt were
made, other tastes would still discover fresh examples.</p>

<p class='c011'>The following is, in a few words, the plan and structure of the
poem:—Its professed object is to emancipate mankind from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>debasing effects of superstition by an exposition of the leading
tenets of the Epicurean school. It is divided into six books. In
the first, the poet enunciates and copiously illustrates the grand
axiom of his system of the universe, together with the corollaries
which necessarily arise from it. “Nothing is created out of nothing.”
He commences also the subject of the atomic theory.
In the second book he pursues the subject of creation generally,
and the various functions of animal life. The third treats of the
nature of the soil. The fourth contains the theory of sensation,
especially of sight; of the relation which thought bears to matter;
of the passions, and especially of the influence of love, both physical
and moral. The fifth book is devoted to the history of
mankind. The sixth explains the phenomena of the natural
world, including those of disease and death.</p>

<p class='c011'>The following are the leading Epicurean doctrines imbodied
in the poem:—There are divine beings, but they are neither the
creators<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c012'><sup>[477]</sup></a> nor the governors of the world.<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c012'><sup>[478]</sup></a> They live in the enjoyment
of perfect happiness and repose, regardless of human
affairs, unaffected by man’s virtues and vices, happiness or misery.
Neither have they the power any more than the will to interfere
in the affairs of the world, for they cannot resist the eternal laws
of nature and destiny. Whilst, in deference to the innate sense
which revolts at the denial of a God, he acknowledges the existence
of divine beings, the proofs which he adduces as derived
from his great master are weak and unsatisfactory.<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c012'><sup>[479]</sup></a> The corollary
of this disbelief in Divine Providence is practical atheism.
The ideas which man entertains of God are false, because they
are the mere creations of the imagination. Ignorant of the real
causes which lead to natural phenomena, he conjures up these as
the machinery to account for them.<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c012'><sup>[480]</sup></a> The popular belief is
groundless; and yet the poet believes that if this system is overthrown
there is nothing to supply its place, and hence all worship,
whether prayer or praise, is grovelling superstition.<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c012'><sup>[481]</sup></a> The only
true piety consists in calm and peaceful contemplation.<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c012'><sup>[482]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>To those who argue that unbelief leads to ungodliness, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>answer is that what man calls religion has led to the greatest
crimes.<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c012'><sup>[483]</sup></a> He is not entirely destitute of the religious sentiment
or the principle of faith, for he deifies nature<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c012'><sup>[484]</sup></a> and has a veneration
for her laws; and hence his infidelity must be viewed rather
in the light of a philosophical protest against the degrading results
of heathen superstition than a total rejection of the principle
of religious faith.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is here that Lucretius seems for awhile to leave the authority
of Epicurus; and with the inspiration of a poet, which
is hardly consistent with a total absence of veneration and faith,
to forsake his cold and heartless system. Although he asserts
that the phenomena of nature are the result of a combination
of atoms, that these elementary particles are self-existent and
eternal, he seems to invest nature with a sort of personality.
The warm sensibility of the poet overcomes the cold logic of
the philosopher. Dissatisfied with the ungenial idea of an abstract
lifeless principle, he yearns for the maternal caresses of
a being endued with energies and faculties with which he can
sympathize. He therefore ascribes to nature an attribute which
can only belong to an intelligent agent having ruling power.
Nay, he even goes farther than this, and absolutely contradicts
the dogmas of the Epicurean school. Even the works of nature are
represented as instinct with life.<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c012'><sup>[485]</sup></a> The sun is spoken of as
a being who, by the warmth of his beams, vivifies all things:
the earth, from whose womb all things spring, fosters and nurtures
all her children. The very stars may possibly be living
beings, performing their stated motions in search of their proper
sustenance.<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c012'><sup>[486]</sup></a> These are, doubtless, the fancies of the poet
rather than the grave and serious belief of the philosopher; but
they prove how false, hollow, and artificial is a system which
pretends to account for creation by natural causes, and how
earnestly the human mind craves after the comfort and support
of a personal deity.</p>

<p class='c011'>The denial of the immortality of the soul is inferred from the
destructibility of the material elements out of which it is composed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>It must perish immediately that it is deprived of the
protection of the body.<a id='r487' /><a href='#f487' class='c012'><sup>[487]</sup></a> In accordance with this psychical
theory, he accounts for the difference of human tempers and
characters. Character results from the combination of the
elementary principles:—a predominance of heat produces the
choleric disposition; that of wind produces timidity; that of air
a calm and equable temper.<a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c012'><sup>[488]</sup></a> But this natural constitution, the
strength of the will, acted upon by education, is able, to a certain
extent, to modify, though it cannot effect a complete change.
Thus it is that, although moral as well as physical phenomena
are produced in accordance with fixed laws, human ills result
from unbridled passions, and may be remedied by philosophy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although, if tried by a Christian standard, the Lucretian morality
is by no means pure,<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c012'><sup>[489]</sup></a> yet even where he permits laxity
he is not insensible to the moral beauty, the happy and holy results
of purity and chastity.<a id='r490' /><a href='#f490' class='c012'><sup>[490]</sup></a> Nor, notwithstanding the assertions
of Cicero,<a id='r491' /><a href='#f491' class='c012'><sup>[491]</sup></a> can the charge of immorality or of a selfish love
of impure pleasure be made against Lucretius or Epicurus. The
distinction which the latter drew between lawful and unlawful
pleasures was severe and uncompromising. The former speaks
of the hell which the wicked sensualist always carries within
his own breast<a id='r492' /><a href='#f492' class='c012'><sup>[492]</sup></a>—of the satisfaction of true wisdom,<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c012'><sup>[493]</sup></a> and of a
conscience void of offence.<a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c012'><sup>[494]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Again, Epicurus was a man of almost Christian gentleness.
Stoical grossness and contempt of refinement revolted him; the
unamiable severity of that sect was alien to his nature. He was
thus driven to the opposite extreme; and although he was careful
to make pure intellectual pleasure the <i>summum bonum</i>, his
standard laid him open to objections from his jealous adversaries.
The zeal with which many distinguished females devoted
themselves to his system, and became his disciples because
his doctrines and character especially recommended themselves
to the female sex, made it easy for his enemies to stigmatize them
as <i>effeminate</i>, instead of praising them as <i>feminine</i>. With that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>illiberality which refused to woman freedom of conduct and a
liberal education, his adversaries calumniated the characters of
his pupils, represented them as unchaste, and their instructor as
licentious. Nor did they hesitate even to support these accusations
by forgeries.<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c012'><sup>[495]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>A careless reception of their calumnies without investigation,
added to the general, and perhaps wilful, misapprehension which
prevailed among the Romans in the days of Cicero, led to the
misrepresentations which are found in his writings. These have
been handed down to after ages: and thus the doctrines taught
by Epicurus have been loaded with undeserved obloquy.<a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c012'><sup>[496]</sup></a> There
is, however, no doubt that Epicurism was adopted by the Romans
in a corrupt form, and that it became fashionable because
it was supposed to encourage indifferentism and sensuality. It
is probable, too, that the denial of immortality contributed much
to the depravation and distortion of his system. Nothing so
surely demoralizes as destroying the hopes of eternity. Man
cannot commune with God, or soar on high to spiritual things,
unless he hopes to be spiritualized and to see God as He is.
Whatever the philosopher may teach as to the true nature of
happiness, man will set up his own corrupt standard, which his
passions and appetites lead him to prefer: he will act on the
principle “Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.” Still
it must be confessed that the views of Epicurus respecting man’s
duty to God were disinterested—founded on ideas of the Divine
perfections, not merely on hopes of reward.<a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c012'><sup>[497]</sup></a> His views of
sensual pleasures were in accordance with his simple, frugal life,
diametrically opposed to intemperance and excess. He taught
by example as well as by precept, that he who would be happy
must cultivate wisdom and justice, because virtue and happiness
are inseparable. He attached his disciples to him by affection
rather than by admiration; submitted to weakness and sickness
with patient resignation; and died with a heroism which no Stoic
could have surpassed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such was the master whom Lucretius followed, and the
school to which he belonged; and though the sternness of the Roman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>character breathed into his protest against superstition a
bolder spirit of defiance than that of the placid and resigned
Greek, his teaching was equally pure and noble, and he would
have proudly disdained to make philosophy a cloak for voluptuous
profligacy. Poets who surpassed him in gracefulness, and
who were fortunate enough to flourish when the Latin language

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Catullus</span> (<span class='fss'>BORN B. C.</span> 86.)</h4>

<p class='c018'>Contemporary with the great didactic poet, but nine years
his junior in age, flourished C. Valerius Catullus. He was a
member of a good family, residing on the Lago di Garda, in the
neighbourhood of Verona,<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c012'><sup>[500]</sup></a> and his father had the honour of
frequently receiving Cæsar as his guest.<a id='r501' /><a href='#f501' class='c012'><sup>[501]</sup></a> At an early age he
went to Rome, probably for education, but his warm temperament
and strong passions plunged him into the licentious excesses
of the capital. During this period of his career, passed in
the indulgence of pleasure and gayety, and in the midst of a dissipated
society, he had no more serious occupation than the cultivation
of his literary tastes and talents. The elegant tenderness
of his amatory poetry made him a favourite with the fair
sex, for its licentiousness was not out of keeping with the sentiments
and conversation prevalent in the Roman fashionable
world. It must not be supposed that the tone of society
amongst the higher classes was pure and moral, like that of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>Cicero and his friends, or that it was not marked by the same
licentious freedom which polluted some even of their most graceful
poems.</p>

<p class='c011'>The poetry of Catullus was such as might be expected from
the tenor of his life. The excuse which he made for its character
was not a valid one;<a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c012'><sup>[502]</sup></a> for the line in Hadrian’s epitaph on Voconius
could not possibly be applied to him:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>His mistress, whom he addresses under the feigned name of
Lesbia, was really named Clodia.<a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c012'><sup>[504]</sup></a> It has been said that she
was the sister of the infamous Clodius; but there are no grounds
for the assertion.</p>

<p class='c011'>A career of extravagance and debauchery terminated in ruin,
and though his fortune had been originally ample, his affairs
became hopelessly embarrassed; and in order to retrieve them
by colonial plunder, he accompanied Memmius, the friend of
Lucretius, when he went as prætor to Bythinia. Owing, however,
to the grasping meanness of his patron his expectations
were disappointed. He returned home “with his purse full of
cobwebs.” Still he enjoyed the privilege of visiting those cities
of Greece and Asia which were the most celebrated for literature
and the fine arts.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he went to Asia he visited the grave of a brother who
had died in the Troad, and who was buried on the Rhætian promontory;
and a poem which he addressed on the occasion to Hortalus,
the dissipated son of the orator Hortensius, as well as
another dedicated to Manlius, bear witness to the warmth of his
fraternal affection. The former is a beautiful and touching specimen
of his elegiac style:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c022'>On his return to Rome he resumed his old habits, and died in
the prime of life, probably <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 47, as that is the latest date to
which allusion is made in his writings.</p>

<p class='c011'>His works consist of numerous short fugitive pieces of a lyrical
character; elegies, such as that already quoted; a secular
hymn to Diana; a poem, somewhat of a dithyrambic character,
entitled Atys; and the Epithalamium of Peleus and Thetis, a mythological
poem in heroic verse. His taste was evidently formed
on a study of the Greek poets, from whom he learnt not only
his beautiful hendecasyllables, but also their modes of thought
and expression. He had skill and taste to adopt the materials
with which his vast erudition furnished him, and to conceal his
want of originality and inspiration. Some of his pieces are
translations from the Greek, as, for example, the elegy on the
hair of Berenice, which is taken from the Greek of Callimachus,
and the celebrated ode of Sappho.<a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c012'><sup>[505]</sup></a> He was one of the most popular
of the Roman poets—firstly, because he possessed those
qualities which the literary society of Rome most highly valued,
namely, polish and learning; and secondly, because, although he
was an imitator, there is a living reality about all that he wrote—a
truly Roman nationality. He did not merely disguise the inspiration
of Greece in a Latin dress, but invested Roman life,
and thoughts, and social habits with the ideal of Greek love and
beauty. For these reasons his fame flourished as long as Rome
possessed a classical literature. Two eminent men only have
withheld their admiration—Horace in the golden age; Quintilian
in the period of the decline. The former disparages him as a
lyrical poet; the latter almost passes him over in silence. Horace
was jealous of a rival who was so nearly equal to himself: he
could not bear the remotest chance of his claim being disputed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>to be the musician of the Roman lyre;<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c012'><sup>[506]</sup></a> and he dishonestly declared
that he first adapted Æolian strains to the Roman lyre,<a id='r507' /><a href='#f507' class='c012'><sup>[507]</sup></a>
notwithstanding the Lesbian character and hendecasyllabic metres
of his predecessor. Quintilian could not appreciate Catullus,
because his own taste was too stiff and affected, and spoilt by the
rhetorical spirit of his age.</p>

<p class='c011'>Catullus had a talent for satire, but his satire was not inspired
by a noble indignation at vice and wrong. It was the bitter
resentment of a vindictive spirit: his love and his hate were both
purely selfish. His language of love expresses the feelings of
an impure voluptuary; his language of scorn those of a disappointed
one. He gratified his irritable temper by attacking
Cæsar most offensively; but the noble Roman would not crush
the insect which annoyed him; and although Catullus insulted
him personally by reading his lampoons in his presence, not a
change passed over his countenance: he would not stoop to
avenge himself: and the imperial clemency disarmed the anger
of the libeller. The strong prejudice of Niebuhr in favour of
Roman antiquity led him to pronounce Catullus a gigantic and
extraordinary genius, equal in every respect to the lyric poets
of Greece previously to the time of Sophocles; he believed him
to be the greatest poet Rome ever possessed, except, perhaps,
some few of the early ones; but that great man also thought that
Virgil had mistaken his vocation in becoming an epic instead of
a lyric poet.<a id='r508' /><a href='#f508' class='c012'><sup>[508]</sup></a> Catullus certainly possessed great excellences and
talents of the most alluring and captivating kind. No genius
ever displayed itself under a greater variety of aspects. He has
the playfulness and the petulance of a girl, the vivacity and simplicity
of a child. He has never been surpassed in gracefulness,
melody, and tenderness. No one, unless he possessed the coolness
and self-command of a Cæsar, could have avoided wincing under
the sharp attacks of his wit: he had passion and vehemence, but
he had not the grandeur and sublimity either of Lucretius or
Virgil.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although the peculiar characteristics of his poetry are chiefly
to be found in his lyric and elegiac poems, there are in his longer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>pieces, which are less known and less admired, passages of singular
sweetness and beauty. He had not sufficient grasp and
comprehensiveness of mind to conduct an epic poem. His knowledge
of human nature, confined as it was to one of its phases—the
development of the softer affections—did not admit of sufficient
variety for so vast a work. His intellectual taste, like his
moral principles, was too ill-regulated to construct a well-digested
plan, necessary to the perfection of an epic poem; but wherever
ingenuity and liveliness in description, or pathos in moving the
affections, are required, the poetry of Catullus does not yield to
that of Ovid or of Virgil.</p>

<p class='c011'>The poem, entitled the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, bears
some slight resemblance to an heroic poem. Its subject is heroic,
for it imbodies a legend of the heroic age. The characters of
mythology play a part in it, similar to that which they support
in the poems of Homer or Virgil. But it is unconnected and
deficient in unity; and the plan is far too extensive for the dimensions
by which it is circumscribed. Nevertheless, with all
these faults, it is pleasing on account of the luxuriance of its
fancy and the brilliancy of its genius. The most beautiful passage,
perhaps, is the episode relating the story of Theseus and
Ariadne, which is introduced into the main body of the poem as
being woven and embroidered on the hangings of the palace of
Holeus. The following verses are taken from this episode,<a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c012'><sup>[509]</sup></a> and
form part of the complaint of Ariadne for the perfidious desertion
of Theseus:—</p>

<p class='c011'>The writers of the Augustan age and their successors paid
Catullus what they considered the highest compliment, when
they called him <i>learned</i>. Criticism referred everything to the
Greek standard. The qualities which they recognised by this
epithet were those which they deemed most valuable—more so
even than originality and invention—an extensive acquaintance
with the materials of Greek story, an elaborate study of the
poets taken as models, a scientific appreciation of the cadences
and harmonies of Greek versification. They were grateful for
the blessings which they were conscious of having derived from
mental cultivation; and the highest praise which they could
bestow was to confer upon a poet the title of a learned and accomplished
man.</p>

<p class='c011'>This period, at which prose reached its zenith, could boast of
other poets, also, besides Lucretius and Catullus, whose merits
were considerable although they did not satisfy the fastidious
taste of the Augustan age. There flourished C. Licinius Calvus,<a id='r510' /><a href='#f510' class='c012'><sup>[510]</sup></a>
C. Helvius Cinna, Valerius Cato, Valgius, Ticida, Furius Bibaculus,
and Varro Atacinus.<a id='t235'></a></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>The first of these was a lively little man,<a id='r511' /><a href='#f511' class='c012'><sup>[511]</sup></a> an orator as well
as a poet. His speeches were elaborately modelled after those
of the Attic orators; and had his poems displayed the same
polish, they might have satisfied Horace<a id='r512' /><a href='#f512' class='c012'><sup>[512]</sup></a> and his contemporaries,
and thus have been preserved. As it is, the fragments which
remain are so brief, that it is impossible to say whether his
merits were such as to justify Niebuhr in placing him amongst
the three greatest poets of his age. His poetry resembled that
of Catullus in spirit and morality. It was the fashionable poetry
of the day, and consisted of tender elegy, playful and sentimental
epigram, licentious love-songs, and bitter personality.</p>

<p class='c011'>Cinna,<a id='r513' /><a href='#f513' class='c012'><sup>[513]</sup></a> besides smaller poems, was the author of an epic, entitled
Smyrna; the subject is unknown: but Catullus, who was
his intimate friend, praises it highly, and Virgil modestly declares
that, as compared with Varius and Cinna, he himself appears a
goose amongst swans.<a id='r514' /><a href='#f514' class='c012'><sup>[514]</sup></a> Valerius Cato was a grammarian as well
as a poet. His two principal poems were entitled Lydia and
Diana;<a id='r515' /><a href='#f515' class='c012'><sup>[515]</sup></a> and a fragmentary poem, to which the title <cite>Diræ</cite> or
<cite>Curses</cite><a id='r516' /><a href='#f516' class='c012'><sup>[516]</sup></a> has been given, has been generally attributed to him on
the grounds that the author pours forth his woes to a mistress
named Lydia. The argument of the piece is as follows:—The
estate of Cato, like that of Virgil, was confiscated and made a
military colony; and smarting under a sense of wrong, he imprecates
curses on his lost home. Then the theme changes: his heart
softens; and in sad accents he bewails his separation from his
mistress, and from all his rural pleasures. This poem was formerly
believed to be the work of Virgil, but neither the language
nor the poetry can be compared to those of the Mantuan bard;
nor do the sentiments resemble the calmness and resignation
with which he bears his misfortunes. J. Scaliger, impressed
with these considerations, transferred the authorship from Virgil
to Cato. But there are no sufficient grounds for determining
the question.</p>

<p class='c011'>Respecting C. Valgius Rufus all is doubt and obscurity. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>grammarians quote from him; Pliny<a id='r517' /><a href='#f517' class='c012'><sup>[517]</sup></a> speaks of his learning;
Horace<a id='r518' /><a href='#f518' class='c012'><sup>[518]</sup></a> refers to him as an elegiac poet, and expresses the
greatest confidence in his critical taste and judgment. Ticida
is mentioned by Suetonius as bearing testimony to the merits of
Valerius Cato. Bibaculus was a bitter satirist, who spared not
the feelings of his friend Cato when reduced from affluence to
poverty;<a id='r519' /><a href='#f519' class='c012'><sup>[519]</sup></a> who himself had the vanity to attempt an epic poem,
and by his vulgar taste provoked the severe criticism of Horace.<a id='r520' /><a href='#f520' class='c012'><sup>[520]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>P. Terentius Varro Atacinus was a contemporary of Varro
Reatinus; and for this reason his works have often been confounded
with those of the latter. He was born <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 82,<a id='r521' /><a href='#f521' class='c012'><sup>[521]</sup></a> near
the river Atax in Gaul, and hence he was surnamed Atacinus,
in order to distinguish him from his learned namesake, who derived
his appellation from property which he possessed at Reati.
Very few fragments of his works are extant,<a id='r522' /><a href='#f522' class='c012'><sup>[522]</sup></a> although his poetry
was of such a character that Virgil deemed some of his lines
worthy of plagiarizing.<a id='r523' /><a href='#f523' class='c012'><sup>[523]</sup></a> His principal work, which is not spoken
of in very high terms by Quintilian,<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c012'><sup>[524]</sup></a> is a translation of the Argonautica
of Apollonius Rhodius. Besides this, he wrote two geographical
poems, namely, the <cite>Chorographia</cite> and <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Libri Navales</span></cite>,
a heroic poem entitled <cite>Bellum Sequanicum</cite>, on one of the Gallic
campaigns of J. Cæsar, and also some elegies, epigrams, and
saturæ.<a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c012'><sup>[525]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>A fragment of the Chorographia is preserved by Meyer,<a id='r526' /><a href='#f526' class='c012'><sup>[526]</sup></a> the
concluding lines of which were evidently imitated by Virgil,
and also the following severe epigram on Licinius:—</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>P. Virgilius Maro</span> (<span class='fss'>BORN B. C.</span> 70.)</h4>

<p class='c018'>The period at which Virgil flourished was singularly favourable
both to the development and appreciation of poetical talent
of the most polished and cultivated kind. The indulgent liberality
of the imperial court cherished and fostered genius: the
ruin of republican liberty left the intellect of the age without
any other object except refinement; imagination was not harassed
by the cares and realities of life. The same causes contributed
to limit the range of prose composition,<a id='r527' /><a href='#f527' class='c012'><sup>[527]</sup></a> and therefore the field
was left undisputed to Virgil and Horace and their friends; and
as the age<a id='t238'></a> of Cicero was essentially one in which prose literature
flourished, so that of Augustus was the golden age of poetry.
Of this age, Virgil stands forth pre-eminent amongst his contemporaries,
as the representative. He exhibited all its characteristics,
polish, ingenuity, and skill, and to these he superadded
dignity and sublimity. The life of Virgil, commonly prefixed
to his works, professes to be written by Tiberius Claudius Donatus,
who lived in the fifth century. If, as Heyne thought, the
groundwork is by him, it has been overlaid with fables similar
to those found in the Gesta Romanorum, and owing their origin
to the inventions of the dark ages. From this biography, stripped
of those portions which are clearly fabulous, and from other
sources, the following particulars respecting him may be derived:—P.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>Virgilius Maro was born on the ides (the 15th) of October,<a id='r528' /><a href='#f528' class='c012'><sup>[528]</sup></a>
<span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 70, on a small estate belonging to his father, at Andes
(Pietola,) a village of Cisalpine Gaul, situated about three Roman
miles from Mantua. It has been disputed whether his name was
Virgilius or Vergilius. Most probably both orthographies are
correct, as <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Diana</span></i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Minerva</span></i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">liber</span></i>, and other Latin words, were
frequently written <i>Deana</i>, <i>Menerva</i>, <i>leber</i>, &amp;c.<a id='r529' /><a href='#f529' class='c012'><sup>[529]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Virgil was by birth a citizen of Mantua,<a id='r530' /><a href='#f530' class='c012'><sup>[530]</sup></a> but not of Rome, for
the full franchise was not extended to the <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Transpadani</span></i> until <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span>
49, although they enjoyed the Jus Latii as early as <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 89. The
varied stores of learning contained in the Georgics and Æneid,
abundantly prove that Virgil received a liberal education. It
is said that he acquired the rudiments of literature at Cremona,
where he remained until he had assumed the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">toga virilis</span></i>.<a id='r531' /><a href='#f531' class='c012'><sup>[531]</sup></a> This
event, if the anonymous life is to be depended upon, took place
unusually early; for it is there assigned to the consulships of
Pompey the Great and Licinius Crassus,<a id='r532' /><a href='#f532' class='c012'><sup>[532]</sup></a> in the first consulship
of whom he was born. From Cremona he went to Milan, and
thence to Naples, where he studied Greek literature and philosophy
under the direction of Parthenius, a native of Bithynia.
Muretus asserts that he diligently read the history of Thucydides;
but his favourite studies were medicine and mathematics—an
unusual discipline to engage the attention of the future
poet, but one which, by its exactness, tended to foster and mature
that judgment which distinguishes his poetry. The philosophical
sect to which he devoted himself was the Epicurean; and the
unfortunate general, P. Quintilius Varus, to whom he addresses
his sixth Eclogue,<a id='r533' /><a href='#f533' class='c012'><sup>[533]</sup></a> studied this system together with him under
Syron.</p>

<p class='c011'>After this, it is probable that he came to Rome, but soon exchanged
the bustle of the capital, for which his bashful disposition
and delicate health unfitted him, for the quiet retirement of his
hereditary estate. Of this he was deprived in <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 42, with
circumstances of great hardship, when the whole neighbouring
district was divided, after the battle of Philippi, amongst the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>victorious legionaries of Octavius and Antony. The town of
Cremona had supported Brutus, and the old republican party,
and Mantua, together with its surrounding district, suffered in
consequence of its too close vicinity.<a id='r534' /><a href='#f534' class='c012'><sup>[534]</sup></a> Asinius Pollio was at that
time commander of the forces in Cisalpine Gaul. He was grinding
and oppressive in his administration; but being himself an
orator, poet, and historian, he patronised literary men. Congenial
tastes recommended Virgil to his notice, and led him to take
compassion on the poet’s desolate condition. By his advice,
Virgil proceeded to Rome with an introduction to Mæcenas.
Through him he gained access to Octavius, and either immediately
before or after the peace of Brundisium<a id='r535' /><a href='#f535' class='c012'><sup>[535]</sup></a> his little farm
was restored to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He now became a prosperous man, was a member of the literary
society which graced the table of Mæcenas, and basked in
sunshine of court favour. Horace, Virgil, Plotius, and Varius,
were united by the closest bonds of friendship with Mæecenas,
and accompanied him on that cheerful expedition to Brundisium,<a id='r536' /><a href='#f536' class='c012'><sup>[536]</sup></a>
when he went thither in order to negotiate a reconciliation between
Octavius and Antony. Henceforth Virgil’s favourite
residence was Naples.<a id='r537' /><a href='#f537' class='c012'><sup>[537]</sup></a> Its sunny climate suited his pulmonary
weakness far better than the low and damp banks of his native
Mincius (Menzo.) He had, besides, a villa in Sicily, and when
at Rome he lived in a pleasant house on the Esquiline, situated
near those of his friends Mæcenas and Horace. It is difficult to
say how Virgil became so rich: patrons were liberal in those
days, and he doubtless owed a portion of his affluence to their
munificence. The liberality of Mæcenas is well known; and
Martial attributes the prosperity of Virgil to the favour of “the
Tuscan knight.”<a id='r538' /><a href='#f538' class='c012'><sup>[538]</sup></a> Augustus also had great wealth at his disposal,
and was profuse in the distribution of it amongst his favourites.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a passage in the Odes of Horace<a id='r539' /><a href='#f539' class='c012'><sup>[539]</sup></a> which seems to hint
that he engaged to a slight extent in mercantile concerns: even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>if this formed one source of his wealth, the love of gain (studium
lucri,) and anxiety about the means of living, do not appear to
have hindered him from devoting his hours of serious occupation
to literary labours and the diligent use of his well-stored library,
whilst his leisure was given to the delights of social intercourse,
for which he was so eminently qualified by his sweet temper and
amiable disposition.</p>

<p class='c011'>The poet’s term of life was not extended far beyond fifty
years. He had never been healthy or robust: he sometimes
spat blood, and frequently suffered from headache and indigestion.<a id='r540' /><a href='#f540' class='c012'><sup>[540]</sup></a>
Ill health was the only drawback to a life otherwise
passed in calm felicity. In the year <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 19 he meditated a
tour in Greece, intending, during the course of it, to give the
final polish to his great epic poem. Greece and her classic
scenes, the favourite haunts of the Muses, the time-honoured
contests of Olympia, the living and breathing statues which he
beheld in that home of art, evidently inspired the beautiful
imagery which adorns the introduction to the third Georgic.
He, however, only reached Athens: there he met Augustus, who
was on his way back from Samos, and both returned together.
On the occasion of this voyage, Horace wrote that tender ode<a id='r541' /><a href='#f541' class='c012'><sup>[541]</sup></a>
in which he affectionately calls him “the half of his soul:”—</p>

<p class='c022'>On the way he was seized with a mortal sickness, which was
aggravated by the motion of the vessel, and he only lived to
land at Brundisium. The powers of nature, already enfeebled,
were now totally exhausted, and he expired on the 22nd of
September. He was buried rather more than a mile from Naples,
on the road to Puteoli (Pozzuoli.) A tomb is still pointed out
to the traveller which is said to be that of the poet. Nor is
this improbable; for, although it is not situated on the present
high-road, it is quite possible that the original direction of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>road may have been changed.<a id='r542' /><a href='#f542' class='c012'><sup>[542]</sup></a> His epitaph is said to have been

</div>

<p class='c011'>Virgil was deservedly popular both as a poet and as a man.
His rivals in literature could not envy one so unassuming and
inoffensive his well-merited success, but loved him as much as
they admired his poetry. The emperor esteemed him, the people
respected him. “Witness,” says Tacitus,<a id='r544' /><a href='#f544' class='c012'><sup>[544]</sup></a> “the letters of Augustus,—witness
the conduct of the people itself, which, when
some of his verses were recited in the theatre, rose <i>en masse</i>, and
showed the same veneration for Virgil, who happened to be
present among the audience, which they were wont to show to
Augustus.” He was exceedingly temperate in his manner of
living; so pure-minded<a id='r545' /><a href='#f545' class='c012'><sup>[545]</sup></a> and chaste in the midst of a profligate
and licentious age, that the Neapolitans gave him the name of
Parthenias (from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παρθενος</span>, a virgin,) unselfish, although surrounded
by selfishness, kind-hearted, and sympathizing. His talents
and popularity never spoiled his natural simplicity and modesty,
as his moving in the polite circles of the capital never could
entirely wear off his rustic shyness and unfashionable appearance.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was constitutionally pensive and melancholy, and so distrustful
of his own poems, that Augustus could not persuade him
to send an unfinished portion of the Æneid to him for perusal.
“As to my Æneas,” he writes to the emperor,<a id='r546' /><a href='#f546' class='c012'><sup>[546]</sup></a> when absent on
his Cantabrian campaign, “if I had anything worth your reading
I would send it with pleasure, but the work is only just begun,
and I even blame my folly for venturing upon so vast a task.
But you know that I shall apply fresh and increased diligence
to carrying out my design.” It was with real reluctance that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>he subsequently read the sixth book to the Emperor and Octavia.
In his last moments he was anxious to burn the whole manuscript;
and in his will he directed his executors, Varius and
Tucca, either to improve it or commit it to the flames.<a id='r547' /><a href='#f547' class='c012'><sup>[547]</sup></a> He was
open-hearted and generous, but not extravagant in the expenditure
of his wealth, for he bequeathed to his brother, his friends,
and the Emperor, a considerable property.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is said that Virgil’s earliest poetical essay was an epic poem,
the subject of which was the Roman wars; but that the impossibility
of introducing Roman names in hexameter verse caused
him to desist from the task almost as soon as he had commenced it.
The minor poems which are still extant, were probably his first
works. These are the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Culex</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ciris</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Moretum</span></cite>, <cite>Copa</cite>, and the
shorter pieces in lyric, elegiac, and iambic metres,<a id='r548' /><a href='#f548' class='c012'><sup>[548]</sup></a> commonly
known by the name of Catalecta. The “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Culex</span></cite>” (Gnat) is a
bucolic poem, with something of a mock-heroic colouring, of
which the argument is as follows:<a id='r549' /><a href='#f549' class='c012'><sup>[549]</sup></a> A shepherd, overcome with
the heat, falls asleep beneath the shade of a tree, and a venomous
serpent from a neighbouring marsh stealthily approaches.
A gnat flies to his rescue, and stings him on the brow. The
shepherd, awoke by the smart, crushes his rescuer, but sees the
serpent and kills it. The ghost of the gnat appears, reproaches
him with his ingratitude, and describes the adventures he has
met with in the regions of the dead. The shepherd erects a
monument in his honour, and indites the following epigram:—</p>

<div class='c016'>

    <div class='group'>

</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>The “<cite class='quote'>Ciris</cite>,” which some have attributed to Corn. Gallus, is
the Greek legend of Scylla, who was changed into a fish, and
her father Nisus into an eagle. Great use has been made by
Spenser of this poem in the conversation between Britomart
and her nurse Glauce, and also in Glauce’s incantations.<a id='r550' /><a href='#f550' class='c012'><sup>[550]</sup></a> The
“<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Moretum</span></cite>,” was intended to trace the employments of the agricultural
labourer through the day; but it only describes the commencement
of them, and the preparation of a dish of <i>olla podrida</i>
of garden herbs called <i>moretum</i>. It contains an ingenious
description of a cottager’s kitchen garden. The “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Copa</span></cite>,” is
an elegiac poem, not unlike in jovial spirit the scolia or drinking
songs of the Greeks: it represents a female waiter at a
tavern, begging for custom by a tempting display of the accommodations
and comforts prepared for strangers. It describes
the careless enjoyment of rural festivity: the simple luxuries of
grapes and mulberries, the fragrant roses, the cheerful grasshoppers,
and timid little lizards of Italy. Nor are the excitements
of the dice, the joys of wine, the blandishments of love
unsung. Dull care is banished far, and the enjoyment of the
present hour inculcated:—</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Amongst the lyric poems of Virgil is a very elegant one on
the villa of his instructor in philosophy, Syron.</p>

<p class='c011'>The poems which first established his reputation were his
Bucolics or Eclogues. This latter title was given them in later
times, implying either that they were selections from a greater
number of poems or imitations of passages selected from the
works of Greek poets.<a id='r551' /><a href='#f551' class='c012'><sup>[551]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The characters in Virgil’s Bucolics are Italians, in all their
sentiments and feelings, acting the unreal and assumed part of
Sicilian shepherds. In fact, the Italians never possessed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>elements of pastoral life, and therefore could not naturally furnish
the poet with originals and models from which to draw his
portraits and characters. They were a simple people, but their
simplicity was rather Ascræan than Arcadian: the domestic
habits and virtues of rural life in Italy were not unlike those
of Bœtia, as described by Hesiod. Virgil, therefore, wisely
took him as his model, and produced a more natural picture of
Italian manners in his Georgics than in his Eclogues. The
denizens of the little towns had the manners and habits of municipal
life: their cultivation was the artificial refinement of
town life, and not the natural sentiments of the contemplative
shepherd. Those who lived in the country were hard-working,
simple-minded peasants, who gained their livelihood by the
sweat of their brow—honest, plain-spoken, rough-mannered,
and without a grain of sentimentality. Pastoral poetry owes
its origin to, and is fostered by, solitude; its most beautiful passages
are of a meditative cast. The shepherd beguiles his loneliness
by communing with his own thoughts. His sorrows are
not the hard struggles of life, but often self-created and imaginary,
or at least exaggerated. When represented as Virgil represents
them in his Bucolics, they are in masquerade, and the
drama in which they form the characters is of an allegorical
kind. The connexion with Italy is rather of an historical than
a moral nature: we meet with numerous allusions to contemporary
events, but not with exact descriptions of Italian characters
and manners. As, therefore, we cannot realize the descriptions,
we can neither sympathize nor admire. Menalcas and Corydon
and Alexis, and the rest, are as much out of place as the
gentlemen and ladies in the garb of shepherds and shepherdesses
in English family pictures. Even the scenery is Sicilian,
and does not truthfully describe the tame neighbourhood of
Mantua. So long as it is remembered that they are imitations
of the Syracusan poet, we miss their nationality, and see at once
that they are untruthful and out of keeping; and Virgil suffers in
our estimation because we naturally compare him with the original
whom he professes to imitate, and we cannot but be aware
of his inferiority: but if we can once divest ourselves of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>idea of the outward form which he has chosen to adopt, and
forget the personality of the characters, we can feel for the
wretched outcast, exiled from a happy though humble home, and
be touched by the simple narrative of their disappointed loves
and child-like woes; can appreciate the delicately-veiled compliments
paid by the poet to his patron; can enjoy the inventive
genius and poetical power which they display; and can be elevated
by the exalted sentiments which they sometimes breathe.
We feel that it is all an illusion; but we willingly permit ourselves
to be transported from the matter-of-fact realities of a
hard and prosaic world.</p>

<p class='c011'>Virgil in his Eclogues was too much cramped by following
his Greek original to present us with true pictures of Italian
country life; although the criticism of his friend Horace with
justice attributes to his rural pieces delicacy of touch and graceful
wit:—</p>

<div class='c016'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The Idylls of Theocritus are transfusions into appropriate
Greek of old popular Sicilian legends which had taken root in
the country, and had become part and parcel of the national
character. His subjects are not always strictly pastoral, for his
characters are sometimes reapers and fishermen.<a id='r553' /><a href='#f553' class='c012'><sup>[553]</sup></a> His language,
characters, sentiments, scenery, habits, incidents, are all Sicilian,
and therefore all are in perfect harmony. The characters of
Theocritus have a specific individuality, and are therefore different
from each other; those of Virgil are generic, the representatives
of a class, and therefore there is little or no variety.
But still Virgil’s defects do not detract much from the enjoyment
experienced in reading his Bucolic poetry. The Aminta
of Tasso, the Pastor Fido of Guarini, the Calendar of Spenser,
the Lycidas of Milton, the Perdita of Shakspeare, the pastorals
of Drayton, Drummond, and Florian, are equally open to objection,
and yet who does not admire their beauties?</p>

<p class='c011'>The Bucolics may be arranged in two classes. Those in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>first are composed entirely after the Greek model, and contain
the following poems:—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>I.</span> The first, in which the poet, representing himself under
the character of Tityrus, expresses his gratitude for the restoration
of his property, whilst Melibœus, as an exiled Mantuan,
bewails his harder fortune.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>II.</span> The second, which is generally supposed to have been the
first pastoral written by him, and is principally copied from the
Cyclops of Theocritus.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>III.</span> The third is an imitation of the fourth and fifth Idylls of
Theocritus, and as well as the seventh, represent improvisatorial
trials of musical skill between shepherds.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>V.</span> The fifth, in which two shepherds pay the last honours to
a departed friend, the one singing his epitaph, the other his apotheosis.
Scaliger<a id='r554' /><a href='#f554' class='c012'><sup>[554]</sup></a> has with good reason supposed that this poem
allegorized the murder and deification of Julius Cæsar. It has
been often imitated by modern poets: the most beautiful imitations
are Spenser’s lament for Dido, Milton’s Lycidas, Drayton’s
sixth Eclogue, and Pomfret’s Elegy on Queen Mary.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>VIII.</span> The eighth, which is imitated from the second and
third Idylls of Theocritus, consists of two parts; and, from the
subject-matter of the second portion, is entitled “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pharmaceutria</span></cite>,”
(the Enchantress.) Two shepherds, Damon and Alphesibœus,
rival Orpheus in their musical skill, for, whilst they sing,
heifers forget to graze, lynxes are stupified, and rivers stop
their course to listen. It was addressed by Virgil to his kind
patron Pollio, whilst employed in his expedition to Illyricum.<a id='r555' /><a href='#f555' class='c012'><sup>[555]</sup></a>
Damon, personifying an unsuccessful lover, laments that a rival
has been preferred to himself. Alphesibœus, in the character
of an enchantress, goes through a formula of magical incantations
in order to regain the lost affections of Daphnis. In this
poem a refrain, or intercalary verse, recurs after intervals of a
few lines. In the song of Damon, the refrain is—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>IV.</span> The fourth, entitled Pollio, which is the most celebrated
of them all, bears no resemblance to pastoral poetry. In the
exordium, the poet invokes the Muses of Sicilian song; but he
professes to attune their sylvan strain to a nobler theme. The
melancholy Perusian war had been brought to a termination.
The reconciliation of Anthony and Octavius had been effected
by the treaty of Brundisium, and all things seemed to promise
peace and prosperity. The contrast was indeed a bright one,
after the havoc and desolation which war had spread through
Italy. The peace ratified with Sextus Pompey at Puteoli
opened the long-closed granaries of Sicily, and plenty succeeded
to famine. The enthusiasm of the poet hailed the return of
the fabled golden age—the reign of Saturn. The songs which
the old bards of Italy professed to have learnt from the Cumæan
Sibyl, and to which legendary tradition attributed a prophetical
meaning, seemed to point to the new era which now
dawned on the Roman empire.</p>

<p class='c011'>The belief of the civilized world was undoubtedly at this time
concentrated on the expectation of some great event, which should
bring peace and happiness to mankind. The divine revelation
which God’s people enjoyed taught them now to expect the advent
of the Messiah; whilst traditions, probably derived through
corrupting channels from the true light of prophecy, taught the
heathen, though more vaguely, to look for the coming of some
great one. The prophetic literature of the East might have
travelled to Europe; and the divine prophecies of Isaiah, and
the other sacred writers, may have been incorporated by native
bards in Italian legends.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bishop Lowth even supposed that the Sibylline predictions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>derived their origin from a Greek version of Messianic prophecies.<a id='r556' /><a href='#f556' class='c012'><sup>[556]</sup></a>
A belief in the inspiration of the Sibyls prevailed in the
early ages of Christianity, and the Emperor Constantine in one
of his orations<a id='r557' /><a href='#f557' class='c012'><sup>[557]</sup></a> quotes from them, and paraphrases Virgil’s Pollio
as an evidence to the truths of the Gospel.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some of the fathers of the Church attributed to them supernatural
power; and the Italian painters, acting under the patronage
of the Roman Church, honoured the four Sibyls as participators
in a knowledge of the Divine counsels. Ambrose<a id='r558' /><a href='#f558' class='c012'><sup>[558]</sup></a> allows
that they were inspired, but by the spirit of evil. Jerome<a id='r559' /><a href='#f559' class='c012'><sup>[559]</sup></a> believes
that this power was given to them by God as a reward for
virginity; and Augustine<a id='r560' /><a href='#f560' class='c012'><sup>[560]</sup></a> thinks that they predicted many truths
concerning Jesus Christ. Justin<a id='r561' /><a href='#f561' class='c012'><sup>[561]</sup></a> adopts a legend which would
account for the similarity between the Sibylline oracles and Hebrew
prophecy. He says that the Cumæan Sibyl, celebrated by
Virgil, was born at Babylon, and was the daughter of Berosus,
the Chaldean historian.</p>

<p class='c011'>If Virgil, in the fourth eclogue, correctly paraphrased the
Sibylline poems, two parallelisms between them and the prophecies
of Isaiah are remarkably striking:<a id='r562' /><a href='#f562' class='c012'><sup>[562]</sup></a>—</p>

<p class='c011'>Many theories have been proposed respecting the child to
whom allusion is made in this eclogue, not one of which was
satisfactory to Gibbon;<a id='r563' /><a href='#f563' class='c012'><sup>[563]</sup></a> but the following is adopted by Heyne
as the most probable. The peace of Brundisium was cemented
by the marriage between Antony and Cæsar’s half-sister Octavia.
She was the widow of Marcellus, and appeared likely to give
birth to a posthumous child. To this child yet unborn, the poet
applies all the blessings promised by the Sibylline oracles, and
predicts that, under his auspices, the peace and prosperity already
inaugurated shall be confirmed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>VI.</span> In the sixth, Virgil represents allegorically, under the
character of Silenus the tutor of Bacchus, his own instructor
Syron; and thus makes it the vehicle of a short account of the
Epicurean philosophy. It was not long since the same subject
had been treated of at greater length by the eloquent Lucretius;
and it is said that when Cicero heard it recited by the mime
Cytheris, he was so struck with admiration as to exclaim that he
was “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magnæ spes altera Romæ</span>.” This eclogue is parodied by
Gay in the Saturday of his Shepherd’s Week.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fss'>X.</span> The tenth can scarcely be distinguished from any other
amatory poem, except that the heroic metre is not so usual in
that species of poetry as the elegiac. The loves of the poet
Gallus are sung; Arcadia is fixed upon as the place of his exile;
and the lay is said to be set to the music of the oaten-pipe of
Sicily: but this eclogue has no other claim to be entitled a bucolic
poem.</p>

<p class='c011'>One passage in this eclogue, which suggested the following
beautiful lines in Milton’s “<cite class='quote'>Lycidas</cite>,” illustrates the truth that
poetry often derives additional beauty from the fact of its being

</div>

<p class='c010'>Didactic poetry is of all kinds the least inviting. As its professed
object is instruction, there is no reason why its lessons
should be conveyed in poetical language—its purpose, could in
fact, be better attained in prose. Pretending, therefore, to
poetry, it demands great skill, elaborate finish and such graces
and embellishments as will conceal its dry character, and recommend
it to the reader’s attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>The beauty of a didactic poem depends only partially on the
just views and correct discrimination which it evinces, and principally
on the beauty of the language, the picturesque force,
and pleasing character of the descriptions, and the interest that
is thrown into the episodes. In fact, the accessaries are the
parts most admired, and extracts brought forward as specimens
of this kind of poetry are invariably of this kind. Poetry naturally
deals with the beauties and terrors of external nature—with
the emotions and passions, whether of a tender or violent
kind—the sober practical rules of life are scarcely within its
sphere. True it is that when all literature was poetical, the
precepts of moral and physical philosophy, and even the dry
commands of laws and institutions, were embodied in a metrical
form; but when literature divides itself into poetry and prose, the
subjects appropriated to each other become spontaneously separate
likewise. For this reason, the Georgics of Virgil especially
display his ability as a poet, his correct taste the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">limæ labor</span>,” the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>pains which he took in polishing and correcting. In none of his
poems can we form a better idea of the description which he
gives of his patient toil, when he says, that “like the she-bear
he brought his poetical offspring into shape by constantly licking
them.”<a id='r564' /><a href='#f564' class='c012'><sup>[564]</sup></a> The majesty of the language elevates the subject, and
divests it of so much of the homeliness as would be inappropriate
to poetry, and yet at the same time it is not too grand or elevated.</p>

<p class='c011'>The following criticism of Addison<a id='r565' /><a href='#f565' class='c012'><sup>[565]</sup></a> is by no means too favourable:—“I
shall conclude this poem to be the most complete,
elaborate, and finished piece of all antiquity. The Æneis is of
a nobler kind; but the Georgic is more perfect in its kind. The
Æneis has a greater variety of beauties in it; but those of the
Georgic are more exquisite. In short, the Georgic has all the
perfection that can be expected in a poem written by the greatest
poet, in the flower of his age, when his invention was ready, his
imagination warm, his judgment settled, and all his faculties in
their full vigour and maturity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rome offered a favourable field for a poet to undertake a
poem on the labours and enjoyments of rural life. Agriculture
was always there considered a liberal employment: tradition
had adorned rustic manners with the attributes of simplicity and
honesty, and divested them of the ideas of coarseness usually
connected with them. The traditions of those ages of national
freedom and greatness, to which the enthusiasm of the poet
delighted to carry back the thoughts of his readers, had connected
some of the noblest names of history with rural labours. Curius
and Cincinnatus were called from the plough to defend and save
their country; and after their task was performed they returned
with delight to it again. Cato, the representative of the old
and respected generation, and other illustrious men, had written
on the pursuits and duties of rural life. Agriculture was never
connected with ideas of debasing and illiberal gain, such as
attached to trade and commerce.</p>

<p class='c011'>The poet, moreover, had a model ready at hand, after which
to construct his work. It was Greek, and therefore sure to be
acceptable upon the recognised principles of taste. It described
a species of rural life, hard, frugal, and industrious, very much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>like that led by the agriculturists of Italy. It painted a standard
of morals, which even the licentious inhabitants of a luxurious
capital could appreciate, though they had degenerated from it.
The discriminating judgment of Virgil saw that the rural life
of Italy could really be represented, in the same way in which
Hesiod had painted that of Bœtia, and he wisely determined—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>To sing through Roman towns Ascræan strains.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>There exists, however, precisely that difference between the
Georgics of Virgil and their model that might be expected. The
Hesiodic poem belongs to a period when poetry was the accidental
form—instruction the essential object; and, therefore, the
teaching is systematic, precise, detailed, homely, sometimes coarse
and unpolished. Virgil looks at his subject from the poetical
point of view. His precepts are often put, not in a didactic but
a descriptive form; they are unhesitatingly interrupted by digressions
and episodes, more or less to the point; and out of a
vast mass of materials such only are selected as are suitable to
awaken the sensibilities.</p>

<p class='c011'>The state of Italy also contributed to enlist a poet’s sympathies
in favour of the rural classes, and to devote his pen to the patriotic
task of reviving the old agricultural tastes. War had
devastated the land; the peasant population had been fearfully
thinned by military conscriptions and confiscation; wide districts
had been depopulated and left destitute of cultivation. Instead
of the sword being beat into a ploughshare and the spear into
a pruning-hook, the Italian peasant had witnessed the contrary
state of things. The poet laments the sad change which now
disfigured the fair face of Italy:—</p>

      <div class='line in47'><cite>Geo.</cite> i. 507.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The credit of having proposed this subject to Virgil is given
to his patron Mæcenas; and, to him, consequently, the Georgics
are addressed; but the poet doubtless gladly adopted the suggestion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>When and where it was commenced is uncertain, but
the finishing stroke was put to it at Naples<a id='r566' /><a href='#f566' class='c012'><sup>[566]</sup></a> some time after the
battle of Actium.<a id='r567' /><a href='#f567' class='c012'><sup>[567]</sup></a> Although the “<cite class='quote'>Works and Days</cite>” of Hesiod
is professedly his pattern, still he derives his materials from
other sources. Aratus supplies him with his signs of the weather,
and the writers <i>de Re Rustica</i> with his practical directions. His
system is indeed perfectly Italian; so much so, that many of his
rules may be traced in modern Italian husbandry, just as the
descriptions of implements in Hesiod are frequently found to
agree with those in use in modern Greece.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first book treats of tillage, the second of orchards; the
subject of the third, which is the noblest and most spirited of
them, is the care of horses and cattle; and the fourth, which is
the most pleasing and interesting, describes the natural instincts
as well as the management of bees.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the great merit of the Georgics consists in their varied
digressions, interesting episodes, and sublime bursts of descriptive
vigour, which are interspersed throughout the poem. To quote
any of them would be unnecessary, as Virgil and his translations
are in every one’s hands. It will be sufficient to enumerate
some of the most striking. These are—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Roman poetry was more generally understood and more diligently
studied in the most polished days of English literature,
than the yet scarcely discovered stores of Greek learning. Want
of originality was not considered a blemish in an age the taste
of which, notwithstanding all its merits, was very artificial;
whilst the exquisite polish and elegance which constitute the
charm of Latin poetry, recommended it both for admiration and
imitation. Hence English poets have been deeply indebted to
the Romans for their most happy thoughts, and our native literature
is largely imbued with a Virgilian and Horatian spirit.
This circumstance adds an especial interest to a survey of Roman
literature as the fountain from which welled forth so many of
the streams that have fertilized our poetry.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Georgics have been frequently taken as a model for imitation,
and our descriptive poets have drawn largely from this
source. Warton<a id='r568' /><a href='#f568' class='c012'><sup>[568]</sup></a> considered Philips’ “<cite class='quote'>Cyder</cite>” the happiest
imitation; “<cite class='quote'>The Seasons</cite>” of our greatest descriptive poet,
Thomson, is a thoroughly Virgilian poem. Many striking instances
of Virgilian taste might be adduced, especially the
thunder-storm in “<cite class='quote'>Summer</cite>,” and the praises of Great Britain, in
“<cite class='quote'>Autumn</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>From the letter already quoted as preserved by Macrobius, it
is clear that the Æneid was commenced when Augustus was in
Spain,<a id='r569' /><a href='#f569' class='c012'><sup>[569]</sup></a> that it occupied the whole of Virgil’s subsequent life,
and was not sufficiently corrected to satisfy his own fastidious
taste when he died. Augustus intrusted its publication to Varius
and Tucca, with strict instructions to abstain from interpolation.
They are said to have transposed the second and third books,
and to have omitted twenty-two lines<a id='r570' /><a href='#f570' class='c012'><sup>[570]</sup></a> as being contradictory to
another passage respecting Helen in the sixth book.<a id='r571' /><a href='#f571' class='c012'><sup>[571]</sup></a> Hence in
many early manuscripts these verses are wanting.</p>

<p class='c011'>The idea and plan of the Æneid are derived from the Homeric
poems. As the wrath of Achilles is the mainspring of all the
events in the Iliad, so on the anger of the offended Juno the
unity of the Æneid depends, and with it all the incidents are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>connected. Many of the most splendid passages, picturesque
images, and forcible epithets are imitations or even translations
from the Iliad and Odyssey. The war with Turnus owes its
grandeur and its interest to the Iliad—the wanderings of Æneas,
their wild and romantic adventures to the Odyssey. Virgil’s
battles, though not to be compared in point of vigour with those
of Homer, shine with a reflected light. His Necyia is a copy of
that in the Odyssey. His similes are most of them suggested
by those favourite embellishments of Homer. The shield of
Æneas<a id='r572' /><a href='#f572' class='c012'><sup>[572]</sup></a> is an imitation of that of Achilles. The storm and the
speech of Æneas<a id='r573' /><a href='#f573' class='c012'><sup>[573]</sup></a> are almost translations from the Odyssey.<a id='r574' /><a href='#f574' class='c012'><sup>[574]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The thoughts thus borrowed from the great heroic poems of
Greece, Virgil interwove with that ingenuity which distinguishes
the Augustan school by means of the double character in which
he represented his hero. The narrative of his perils by sea and
land were enriched by the marvellous incidents of the Odyssey;
his wars which occupy the latter books had their prototype in
the Iliad. Greek tragedy, also, which depicted so frequently
the subsequent fortunes of the Greek chieftains,<a id='r575' /><a href='#f575' class='c012'><sup>[575]</sup></a>—the numerous
translations which had employed the genius of Ennius, Attius,
and Pacuvius—were a rich mine of poetic wealth. The second
book, which is almost too crowded with a rapid succession of
pathetic incidents, derived its interesting details—the untimely
fate of Astyanax, the loss of Creusa, the story of Sinon, the legend
of the wooden horse, the death of the aged Priam, the subsequent
fortunes of Helen—from two Cyclic poems, the Sack of Troy
and the little Iliad of Arctinus. For the legend of Laocoon he
was indebted to the Alexandrian poet, Euphorion. The class
of Cyclic poems entitled the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νοστοι</span> suggested much of the third
book, especially the stories of Pyrrhus, Helenus, and Andromache.
The fourth drew its fairy enchantments partly from Homer’s
Calypso, partly from the love adventures of Jason, Medea,
and Hypsypile in the Argonautica of the Alexandrian poet,
Apollonius Rhodius, which had been introduced to the Romans
by the translation of Varro.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sixth is suggested by the eleventh book of the Odyssey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>and the descent of Theseus in search of Pirithous in the Hesiodic
poems. But notwithstanding the force and originality—the vivid
word-painting which adorns this book—it is far inferior to the
conceptions which Greek genius formed of the unseen world.
In the Æneid the legends of the world of spirits seem but vulgar
marvels and popular illusions. Tartarus and Elysium are too
palpable and material to be believed; their distinctness dispels
the enchantment which they were intended to produce; it is
daylight instead of dim shadow. We miss the outlines, which
seem gigantic from their dim and shadowy nature, the appalling
grandeur to which no one since Æschylus ever attained, except
the great Italian poet who has never since been equalled.</p>

<p class='c011'>To this rich store of Greek learning Italy contributed her
native legends. The adventures of Æneas in Italy—the prophecy,
of which the fulfilment was discovered by Iulus—the
pregnant white sow—the story of the Sibyl—the sylph-like
Camilla—were native lays amalgamated with the Greek legend
of Troy. Macrobius,<a id='r576' /><a href='#f576' class='c012'><sup>[576]</sup></a> in three elaborate chapters, has shown
that Virgil was deeply indebted to the old Latin poets. In the
first he quotes more than seventy parallel turns of expression
from Ennius, Pacuvius, Attius, Nævius, Lucilius, Lucretius, Catullus,
and Varius, consisting of whole or half lines. In the second
he enumerates twenty-six longer passages, which Virgil has imitated
from the poems of Ennius, Attius, Lucretius, and Varius,
amongst which are portions of “<cite class='quote'>The Praises of Rural Life</cite>,” and
of “<cite class='quote'>The Pestilence.</cite>”<a id='r577' /><a href='#f577' class='c012'><sup>[577]</sup></a> In the third he mentions a few (amongst
them, for example, the well-known description of the horse<a id='r578' /><a href='#f578' class='c012'><sup>[578]</sup></a>)
which were taken by Virgil from the old Roman poets, having
been first adopted by them from the Homeric poems. The following
passages are a few of these examples of what would in
modern times be considered plagiarisms, but which the ancients

<p class='c011'>The variety of incidents, the consummate skill in the arrangement
of them, the interest which pervades both the plot and
the episodes, fully compensate for the want of originality—a
defect of which none but learned readers would be aware.
What sweeter specimens can be found of tender pathos than
the legend of Camilla, and the episode of Nisus and Euryalus?
Where is the turbulence of uncurbed passions united with womanly
unselfish fondness, and queen-like generosity, painted with
a more masterly hand than in the character of Dido? Where,
even in the Iliad, are characters better sustained and more
happily contrasted than the weak Latinus, the soldier-like Turnus,
the simple-minded Evander, the feminine and retiring Lavinia,
the barbarian Mezentius, who to the savageness of a wild
beast joined the natural instinct, which warmed with the strongest
affection for his son. The only character of which the conception
is somewhat unsatisfactory is that of the hero himself:
Æneas, notwithstanding his many virtues, fails of commanding
the reader’s sympathy or admiration. He is full of faith in the
providence of God, submits himself with entire resignation to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>His divine will—is brave, patient, dutiful—but he is cold and
heartless, and, if the expression is allowable, unchivalrous. In
his war with Turnus, he is so decidedly in the wrong, and the
character of his injured adversary shines with such lustre, and
is adorned with such gallantry, that one is inclined to transfer
to him the interest and sympathy which ought to be felt for the
hero alone. This is undoubtedly a fault, but it is counterbalanced
by innumerable excellences.</p>

<p class='c011'>In personification, nothing is finer than Virgil’s portraiture
of Fame, except perhaps Spenser’s Despair. In description,
the same genius which shone forth in the Georgics, embellishes
the Æneid also; and both the objects and the phenomena of
nature are represented in language equally vivid and striking.</p>

<p class='c011'>Notwithstanding the question has been much discussed, it is
most probable that the opinion of Pope was correct respecting
the political object of the Æneid. He affirmed that it was as
much a party-piece as Dryden’s Absalom and Achitophel; that
its primary object was to increase the popularity of Augustus;
its secondary one to flatter the vanity of his countrymen by the
splendour and antiquity of their origin. Augustus is evidently
typified under the character of Æneas: both were cautious and
wise in council,<a id='r579' /><a href='#f579' class='c012'><sup>[579]</sup></a> both were free from the perturbations of passion;
they were cold, unfeeling, and uninteresting. Their wisdom
and their policy were calculating and worldly-minded. Augustus
was conscious, as his last words show, that he was acting
a part; and the contrast between the sentiments and conduct of
Æneas, wherever the warm impulses of affection might be supposed
to have sway, likewise create an impression of insincerity.
The characteristic virtue which adorns the hero of the Æneid,
as the epithet “Pius” so constantly applied to him implies, was
filial piety; and there was no virtue which Augustus more ostentatiously
put forward than dutiful affection to Julius Cæsar
who had adopted him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Other characters which are grouped around the central figure
are allegorical likewise—Cleopatra is boldly sketched as Dido,
the passionate victim of unrequited love. Both displayed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>noble, generous qualities, and at the same time the uncontrolled
self-will of a woman, who neither had nor would acknowledge
any master except the object of her affections: the fortunes of
both were similar, for their brothers had become their bitterest
enemies, and the fate of both alike was suicide.</p>

<p class='c011'>Turnus, whose character, as has been already stated, is far
more chivalrous and attractive than that of Æneas, probably
represented the popular Antony; and as the latter violated the
peace ratified at Brundisium and Tarentum, so the former is
represented as treacherous to his engagements with Æneas. It
has even been thought, and the view has been supported by
many ingenious arguments, that Iapis is a portrait of the physician
of Augustus.<a id='r580' /><a href='#f580' class='c012'><sup>[580]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Virgil is especially skilful in that species of imitation which
consists in the appropriate choice of words, and the assimilation
of the sound to the sense. A series of dactyles expresses the
rapid speed of horses, and the still more rapid flight of
time:—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>Many other examples might be adduced<a id='r581' /><a href='#f581' class='c012'><sup>[581]</sup></a> of that which, if it
were an artifice, would be a very pleasing one, which rather
proceeds from the natural impulses of a lively fancy and a delicately-attuned
ear.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dunlop has well observed, that Virgil’s descriptions are more
like landscape-painting than any by his predecessors, whether
Greek or Roman, and that it is a remarkable fact that landscape-painting
was first introduced in his time. Pliny, in his Natural
History,<a id='r582' /><a href='#f582' class='c012'><sup>[582]</sup></a> informs us that Ludius, who flourished in the lifetime
of Augustus, invented the most delightful style of painting, compositions
introducing porticoes, gardens, groves, hills, fish-ponds,
rivers, and other pleasing objects, enlivened by carriages, animals,
and figures. Thus, perhaps, art inspired poetry.</p>

<p class='c011'>No one has ever attempted to disparage the reputation of
Virgil as holding the highest rank amongst Roman poets, except
the Emperor Caligula, J. Markland, and the great historian
Niebuhr. The latter does not hesitate to say that the flourishing
period of Roman poetry ceased about the time of the deaths
of Cæsar and Cicero.<a id='r583' /><a href='#f583' class='c012'><sup>[583]</sup></a> Doubtless Roman national poetry then
ceased, and was succeeded by the new era of Greek taste; but
still the poems of the new school were equally majestic and pathetic,
and though less natural, owed to their Greek originals
incomparably greater polish, grace and sweetness.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is difficult to understand the low opinion which Niebuhr
entertained of Virgil, and the superiority which he attributes to
Catullus. He not only declares that he is opposed to the adoration
with which the later Romans regarded him, but he denies
his fertility of genius and inventive powers. Although he
acknowledges that the Æneid contains many exquisite passages,
he pronounces it a complete failure, an unhappy idea from beginning
to end. It is evident that he looked at the Æneid with
the eye of an historian, and that his objections to it were entirely
of an historical character.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wrapped up in Roman nationality and Italian traditions, he did
not forgive Virgil for adulterating this pure source of antiquarian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>information with Greek legends. He assumes, correctly enough,
that an epic poem, in order to be successful, must be a living narrative
of events known and interesting to the mass of a nation, and
at the same time confesses that, whilst the ancient Italian traditions
had already fallen into oblivion, Homer was at that time
better known than Nævius. Surely, then, if Virgil had drawn
from Italian sources exclusively, he would have omitted much
that would have added interest to his poem in the opinion of his
hearers, and would not have complied with the epic conditions
which Niebuhr himself lays down. Besides, if the traditions
of Nævius were Italian, were not many of the Greek and Italian
traditions which form the framework of the Æneid identical?
Nævius must have drawn largely from the Cyclic poems; and
Niebuhr allows that Virgil copied these parts of his poem from
Nævius.<a id='r584' /><a href='#f584' class='c012'><sup>[584]</sup></a> He asserts his conviction that Virgil’s shield of
Æneas had its model in Nævius, in whose poem Æneas or some
other hero had a shield representing the wars of the giants; and
yet no one could doubt that the shield of Nævius must have
been suggested by the Homeric and Hesiodic poems. Servius
also believed that Virgil borrowed from the poem of Nævius
the plan of the early books of the Æneid.<a id='r585' /><a href='#f585' class='c012'><sup>[585]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Some of Virgil’s minor poems are undoubtedly very beautiful;<a id='r586' /><a href='#f586' class='c012'><sup>[586]</sup></a>
but it is absurd to say that even the greatest elegance in
fugitive pieces of such a stamp can outshine the noble and sublime
passages interwoven throughout the whole structure of the
Æneid. The dispraise of Niebuhr is as exaggerated as the fulsome
compliment paid by Propertius to the genius of his fellow-countryman:—</p>

</div>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Horatius Flaccus</span> (<span class='fss'>BORN B. C.</span> 65.)</h4>

<p class='c018'>Lyric poetry is the most subjective of all poetry, and the
musician of the Roman lyre<a id='r587' /><a href='#f587' class='c012'><sup>[587]</sup></a> was the most subjective of all Latin
poets: hence a complete sketch of his life and delineation of his
character may be deduced from his works. They contain the
elements of an autobiography; and, whilst they constitute the
most authentic source of information, convey the particulars in
the most lively and engaging form.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the period of Horace’s birth the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Libertini</span></i>, or freedmen,
were rapidly rising in wealth, and, therefore, in position. The
Roman constitution excluded the senatorial order from commercial
pursuits, and would not even permit them to own vessels of
any considerable burden, lest they should be made use of in
trade. The old Roman feeling was even more exclusive than
the law. There were certain trades in which not only none
who had any pretensions to the rank of a gentleman, but even
no one who was free-born could engage without degradation.
Cicero<a id='r588' /><a href='#f588' class='c012'><sup>[588]</sup></a> considers that money-lending, manufactures, retail trade,
especially in delicacies which minister to the appetite, are all
sordid and illiberal. He does not even allow that the professions
of medicine and architecture are honourable, except to
such as are of suitable rank. Agriculture is the only method
of money-making which he pronounces to be without any doubt
worthy of free-born men.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>Devoted to the duties of public life either as soldiers or citizens,
the Romans did not comprehend the dignity of labour.
High-minded and unselfish as it may appear to think meanly of
employments undertaken simply for the sake of profit and lucre,
the political result of this pride was unmixed evil. Commerce
was thus thrown into the hands of those whose fathers had been
slaves, and who themselves inherited and possessed the usual
vices of a slavish disposition.</p>

<p class='c011'>The middle classes were impoverished, and, as the unavoidable
consequence of a system in which social position depended upon
property, were rapidly sinking into the lowest ranks of the
population. Here then was a gap to be filled up—the question
was by what means? Had Roman feeling permitted the free-born
citizen to devote his energies to labour and the creation
of capital, he would have risen in the social scale, would have
occupied the place left vacant, and would have brought with
him those sentiments of chivalrous freedom which there can be
no doubt distinguished Rome in earlier times, and advanced her
in the scale of nations. Thus the circulation would have been
complete and healthy, and the national system would have received
fresh life and vigour in its most important part. Instead
of this, however, slaves and the sons of slaves rose to wealth:
not such slaves as those who, well educated and occupying a high
or, at least, a respectable position in the conquered Greek states,
were appreciated by their conquerors, became their friends and
intimates, because of their worth and intellectual acquirements,
imbued their masters with their own refinement and taste, and
were intrusted with the education of their children, but slaves
who had formed the masses of degraded nations. These were
driven in hordes to Rome. They swarmed in all the states of
Italy and Sicily. Many of them were not deficient in ability
and energy, and therefore they rose; but they had little or no
moral principle. Their children intermarried with the lower
classes of the citizens; their blood infected that of the higher
European races which flowed in their veins; and thus the masses
of Rome became a mixed race, but not mixed for the better.
The character changed; but it changed because the old race had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>perished, and a new race with new characteristics occupied its
place.</p>

<p class='c011'>Under such circumstances, the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Libertini</span></i> became a powerful
and important class, both socially and politically: they were the
bankers, merchants, and tradesmen of Rome.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of this class, the father of Horace was one of the most respectable.
His business was that of a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">coactor</span></i>, or agent who collected
the money from purchasers of goods at public auctions. He was
a man of strict integrity, content with his position, and would
not have thought himself disgraced if his son had followed his
own calling.<a id='r589' /><a href='#f589' class='c012'><sup>[589]</sup></a> He had made by his industry a small fortune,
sufficient to purchase an estate near Venusia (Venosa,) on the
confines of Lucania and Apulia, but not sufficient to free him
from the appellation of “a poor man.”<a id='r590' /><a href='#f590' class='c012'><sup>[590]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Here, on the 8th of December (vi<sup>t</sup>o id. Decembr.,) <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 65, Q.
Horatius Flaccus was born; and on the banks of the obstreperous

passed his infant years, and played and wandered in that picturesque
neighbourhood. The natural beauties amidst which he
was nursed, probably did much to form and foster his poetic
tastes. He himself relates, in one of his finest odes,<a id='r593' /><a href='#f593' class='c012'><sup>[593]</sup></a> an adventure
which befell him in his childhood, and which reminds the
reader of the beautiful nursery ballad of the Children in the

he was commonly called the flogging Orbilius (Plagosus Orbilius.<a id='r596' /><a href='#f596' class='c012'><sup>[596]</sup></a>)
With him young Horace read in his own language the poems of
Livius Andronicus and Ennius; and in the Greek, the Iliad of
Homer, whose divine poetry he soon learnt to enjoy.<a id='r597' /><a href='#f597' class='c012'><sup>[597]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Whilst his father took this care of his intellectual education,
he enabled him by dress and a retinue of slaves to associate on
terms of equality with boys far above him in rank and station;<a id='r598' /><a href='#f598' class='c012'><sup>[598]</sup></a>
and, what was still more important, he kept him under his own
roof, and thus secured for his son the benefits of home influences,
sage and prudent advice, and the watchful care of the parental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>eye.<a id='r599' /><a href='#f599' class='c012'><sup>[599]</sup></a> For his father’s liberality, good example, and constant
attention, Horace expresses the deepest gratitude,<a id='r600' /><a href='#f600' class='c012'><sup>[600]</sup></a> and to him
he acknowledges himself indebted for all the good points of his
character. The practical nature of this indulgent and devoted
father’s instruction—how he delighted to teach by example
rather than by precept—is simply told by Horace himself<a id='r601' /><a href='#f601' class='c012'><sup>[601]</sup></a> in
one of his satires.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before he arrived at man’s estate, it is probable that he lost
his wise adviser, for he never mentions his father except in connexion
with the years of his boyhood. Perhaps this is the reason
why, in his earlier poetry, his genial freedom so often degenerated
into licentiousness, and his love of pleasure tempted him
to adopt the dissolute manners of a corrupt age. His moral sense
was accurate and just—he could see what was useful and approve
it; he could censure the vices of his contemporaries—but he had
lost that wise counsel which had hitherto preserved him pure.</p>

<p class='c011'>Athens was at that period the university of Rome. Thither
the Roman youth resorted to learn language, art, science, and
philosophy:—</p>

<p class='c011'>Horace commenced his residence there at a great political
crisis, and the politics of Rome created a vivid interest in the
young students at Athens. He had not lived there long, when
Julius Cæsar was assassinated; and many of his fellow students,
as was natural to youthful and ardent minds, zealously embraced
the republican party. Horace, now twenty-two years of age,
joined the army of Brutus, and served under him until the battle
of Philippi in the rank of a military tribune.<a id='r603' /><a href='#f603' class='c012'><sup>[603]</sup></a> He must have
already become distinguished, since nothing but merit could
have recommended the son of a freedman to Brutus for so high
a military command. But the event proved that he had sadly
mistaken his vocation, for he was totally unfit for the position
either of an officer or a soldier.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>With the rest of the vanquished he fled from the field of Philippi;
and in a beautiful and affectionate ode<a id='r604' /><a href='#f604' class='c012'><sup>[604]</sup></a> to Pompeius Varus,
he confesses that he even threw away his shield; nor was he one
of those who rallied, although his friend was carried back again
into the bloody conflict of the tide of war. So at any rate he
himself tells the story. It may have been, however, that his
vanity prompted him to pretend a resemblance in this respect
to his favourite Alcæus, or perhaps he wished to address a piece
of courtly flattery to the conqueror. Varus was one of his earliest
friends: together they had spent days of study and of festivity;
and when troublous times had separated them, nothing can
exceed the wild and tumultuous joy with which Horace looks
forward to a reunion with his friend.</p>

<p class='c011'>On his return to Rome he found that his father was dead, and
his patrimony confiscated.<a id='r605' /><a href='#f605' class='c012'><sup>[605]</sup></a> In order to obtain a livelihood, he
purchased a clerk’s place under the quæstor.<a id='r606' /><a href='#f606' class='c012'><sup>[606]</sup></a> For its duties he
must have been totally unfit, for he hated business<a id='r607' /><a href='#f607' class='c012'><sup>[607]</sup></a> and loved
pleasure and literary ease. But on the income of this office,
and the kindness of his friends, he lived a life of frugality and
poverty.<a id='r608' /><a href='#f608' class='c012'><sup>[608]</sup></a> It is possible that even then he gained some profit
from his poems, for he says,<a id='r609' /><a href='#f609' class='c012'><sup>[609]</sup></a> “Audacious poverty drove me to
write verses.” Perhaps when he became more prosperous, he
resigned his place, for he does not mention it in the account he
gives to Mæcenas of the usual, daily avocations of his careless
and sauntering life.<a id='r610' /><a href='#f610' class='c012'><sup>[610]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Soon, however, his fortunes began to brighten. His talents
recommended him, when about twenty-four years of age, to
Virgil and Varius.<a id='r611' /><a href='#f611' class='c012'><sup>[611]</sup></a> They were then the leading poets at Rome;
and Mæcenas, the polished but somewhat effeminate friend of
Augustus, was the powerful patron of genius and the head of
literary society. These two poets were warmly attached to
Horace, whose affection for them was equally strong,<a id='r612' /><a href='#f612' class='c012'><sup>[612]</sup></a> and to
them he owed his introduction to the favourite of the emperor.<a id='r613' /><a href='#f613' class='c012'><sup>[613]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>He felt rather timid at the interview: Mæcenas spoke to him
with his usual reserved and curt manner, took no notice of him
for nine months, and then sent for him and enrolled him in the
number of his friends. Thenceforth Horace enjoyed uninterruptedly
his friendship and intimacy—of the affectionate nature
of which many evidences may be found in those poetical pieces
which Horace addressed to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Mæcenas rose in influence and favour with Augustus, he
also procured the advancement of his friend. When he was sent
by Augustus on the delicate mission of effecting a reconciliation
with Anthony, Horace accompanied him;<a id='r614' /><a href='#f614' class='c012'><sup>[614]</sup></a> and it is not impossible
that his shipwreck off Cape Palinurus occurred when he was sailing
with Mæcenas on his expedition against S. Pompey.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this period of his life he commenced the composition of his
first book of Satires.<a id='r615' /><a href='#f615' class='c012'><sup>[615]</sup></a> The knowledge of human life which he
had begun to acquire when he lived, as it were, upon the town,
and became acquainted with the manners, habits and modes of
thinking of the masses, was afterwards cultivated, refined and
matured by intercourse with the best literary society. His observant
mind found ample materials for satire at the table of the
courtly Mæcenas, and amidst the brilliant circle by which he
was surrounded. In this, his first publication, he also introduces
himself to the reader’s notice, draws a lively picture of his youth,
and describes the life which was congenial to his tastes, and
which his change of circumstances permitted him to lead.</p>

<p class='c011'>But it must not be supposed that he wrote nothing at that time
except satire. Some of his odes, which display the strength of
youthful passions and the loosest morality, were probably written
as separate fugitive pieces, and circulated privately amongst his
friends. The ode to Canidia narrates a circumstance in the
early part of his poetical career. The Epodes breathe the spirit
of the satirist rather than of the lyric poet; and therefore the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>coarsest of them<a id='r616' /><a href='#f616' class='c012'><sup>[616]</sup></a> also may belong to the same period,<a id='r617' /><a href='#f617' class='c012'><sup>[617]</sup></a> although
the book which bears that name was not completed and published
as a whole until some years subsequently.</p>

<p class='c011'>The bitterness of some of the Epodes is more suitable to his
years of adversity, and the hard struggles by which the temper
is soured, than to that life of ease and comfort which patronage
enabled him to lead. Then his temper resumed its wonted placidity,
whilst his moral taste was refined; his Archilochian iambics
became less cutting, and his ideas less gross; personal invective
was laid aside, and his indignation was only aroused by
the prospect of political troubles and the horrors of civil commotions.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mæcenas accompanied his friendship with substantial favours.
He gave him, or procured for him by his influence, the public
grant of his Sabine farm. It was situated in a beautiful valley
near Digentia (Licenza.) Being about fifteen miles from Tibur
(Tivoli,) it was sufficiently near the capital to suit the fickle poet,
who, when there, often regretted the luxury, and gossip, and brilliant
society of Rome, and, when at Rome, sighed for the frugal
table, the quiet retirement, the rural employment of his country
abode. The rapid alternation of town and country life, which
the possession of this estate enabled Horace to enjoy, gives a peculiar
charm to his poetry. The scene is ever changing: his mind
reflects the tenor of his life; simple pictures of rural life, and
the elegant refinements of polished society, relieve one another,
and prevent dulness and satiety. The property was neither extensive
nor fertile, but it was sufficient for his moderate wants
and wishes, which are so beautifully expressed in his sixth Satire—a
poem which has found many modern imitators.</p>

<p class='c011'>At Rome, Horace occupied a house on the pleasant and healthful
heights of the Esquiline. Here he resided during the winter
and spring, with the exception of occasional sojourns at Baiæ,
or other places of fashionable resort, on the southern coast of
Italy. Summer and autumn he passed at his Sabine farm, where
he was a great favourite with his simple neighbours, and where
he found all that he ever wished for, and even more.</p>

<p class='c022'>He coveted not his neighbour’s field,<a id='r619' /><a href='#f619' class='c012'><sup>[619]</sup></a> even though it disfigured
his own. He never prayed that chance might throw in his way
a buried vase of silver.<a id='r620' /><a href='#f620' class='c012'><sup>[620]</sup></a> The calm of his life contrasted favourably
with the hundred affairs—not so much his own as of other
people—which tormented him at Rome;<a id='r621' /><a href='#f621' class='c012'><sup>[621]</sup></a> the importunities of
his friends that he would use his influence in their behalf with
Mæcenas;<a id='r622' /><a href='#f622' class='c012'><sup>[622]</sup></a> the growing envy to which his good fortune subjected
him:<a id='r623' /><a href='#f623' class='c012'><sup>[623]</sup></a> his only cares were to store up provisions for his frugal
maintenance during the year,<a id='r624' /><a href='#f624' class='c012'><sup>[624]</sup></a> so that he might live in sweet
forgetfulness of how he lived.<a id='r625' /><a href='#f625' class='c012'><sup>[625]</sup></a> His days were divided between
the books of the ancients,<a id='r626' /><a href='#f626' class='c012'><sup>[626]</sup></a> the philosophy of Plato, and the lively
scenes of Menander.<a id='r627' /><a href='#f627' class='c012'><sup>[627]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The pleasing labours of the farm served him by way of exercise,
although his town habits and awkwardness, and perhaps
his short and stout figure, panting and perspiring under the heat
and exertion, sometimes provoked good-humoured laughter.<a id='r628' /><a href='#f628' class='c012'><sup>[628]</sup></a>
At times, although he confessed how dangerous was the siren
voice of sloth, he would spend hours of musing idleness on the
margin of his favourite stream, listening to its murmurs, and to
the music of the shepherd’s reed as it echoed through the Arcadian
glen.<a id='r629' /><a href='#f629' class='c012'><sup>[629]</sup></a> The evenings were devoted to social converse with
honest and virtuous friends, from which scandal and gossip were
banished; the conversation usually turning on moral and philosophical
discussion,<a id='r630' /><a href='#f630' class='c012'><sup>[630]</sup></a> whilst its seriousness was occasionally relieved
by witty anecdotes and pointed fables, of which those of
the town and country mice, and of the madman who, when cured,
complained that his friends had destroyed all the happiness of
his dreamy life, furnish examples. At these <i>petits soupers</i>,
which he called “suppers of the gods,” the guests drank as much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>or as little as they pleased of his old wine, and enjoyed perfect
freedom from the absurd laws which Roman custom permitted
the chairman (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">arbiter bibendi</span></i>) on such occasions to impose.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sometimes, when the heat of summer was intense, he retired to
the lofty Præneste (Palestrina,) where the climate was always
cool and refreshing.<a id='r631' /><a href='#f631' class='c012'><sup>[631]</sup></a> At some period of his life, also, he became
possessed of a villa at Tibur (Tivoli,) of which the shady groves
and roaring waterfalls furnished him a delightful refreshment after
“the smoke, and magnificence, and noise of Rome.” Here he
wrote many of his satires, and thus achieved the reputation as a
satirist of which he had laid the foundation already; and was
enabled to boast that, though earnestly desirous of peace with the
world, it were better not to provoke him; that he who dared to
offend him should smart for it, and be the laughing-stock of the
whole city.<a id='r632' /><a href='#f632' class='c012'><sup>[632]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The composition and arrangement of the second book of Satires
probably occupied the thirtieth, thirty-first, and thirty-second
years of the poet’s life,<a id='r633' /><a href='#f633' class='c012'><sup>[633]</sup></a> and it was not published until the following
year. This date will allow time for the expiration of more
than seven or eight years since his intimacy with Mæcenas commenced.<a id='r634' /><a href='#f634' class='c012'><sup>[634]</sup></a>
The Satires were followed by the publication of the
Epodes, very soon after the battle of Actium,<a id='r635' /><a href='#f635' class='c012'><sup>[635]</sup></a> for the ninth is
evidently an epinician ode on the occasion of that victory.
Many of them contain noble sentiments, patriotic advice,
burning indignation against the oriental self-indulgence of Antony,<a id='r636' /><a href='#f636' class='c012'><sup>[636]</sup></a>
the servility of Rome, its civil strife, and the degeneracy
of the age; and remind us that, before Horace became an Epicurean
and a courtier, he had fought against a tyrant in the
ranks of freedom.<a id='r637' /><a href='#f637' class='c012'><sup>[637]</sup></a> The first Epode was written just before
the battle of Actium; the second and third at the period when
he first exchanged the life of a fashionable man about town for
that of a country gentleman. We see in one the delight which
he derived from the consciousness that his estate was his own;
that he had no pecuniary embarrassments any longer; his anticipations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>of the happiness to be enjoyed in the regularly-recurring
labours of rural life; in the absence of all care; in the kind-hearted
anticipations of humble domestic felicity; the superiority of
a healthful meal to all the luxuries that wealth could purchase.
In the other, notwithstanding all these professions of sentiment,
he shows that his refined urbanity is shocked by the grossness of
rural habits. His delicate nose cannot endure the smell of garlic:
to him it is nothing less than poison, such as Canidia or Medea
might have used. It is more deadly than the malaria of Apulia,
or the envenomed robe steeped in the blood of Nessus. Nay, in
the same spirit Johnson said that “He who would make a pun
would pick a pocket,” he does not scruple to affirm that a garlic-eater
would commit parricide.</p>

<p class='c011'>The seventh Epode is a burst of indignant expostulation
against the fratricidal madness which, at the bidding of an unprincipled
woman, armed Romans against each other in that tragical
episode, the Perugian war, when the first struggle took
place between the civilians and the soldiers for political influence
and power. In the Epodes the spirit is that of the satirist exaggerated.
The outward form which he had modelled by a
careful study of the Archilochian verse, prepared him for the cultivation
of that poetry in which he stands pre-eminent. It was
the state of transition through which he passed before he became
a lyric poet.</p>

<p class='c011'>With their publication concludes the first period of Horace’s
literary life. It was now flowing on calmly and peaceably, undisturbed
by anxiety either about himself or his country. Although
the civil wars were not yet ended, or the peace of the
world solemnly and finally proclaimed, until the temple of Janus
was closed,<a id='r638' /><a href='#f638' class='c012'><sup>[638]</sup></a> the course of Octavius to universal empire lay plain
and open before him. Rome was at his feet, and owed to him
its safety and prosperity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Public and private well-doing developed a new phase of Horace’s
genius. His muse soared to heights which had only been
attempted by Pindar and the other Greek lyric poets. It cannot,
of course, be supposed that he lived to the age of thirty-five
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>years without having written many of those odes, which
are so full of a youthful sprightliness and burning passion; but
it is certain that many more were written, and the first three
books published, during the period of eight years included between
his thirty-fifth and forty-second years;<a id='r639' /><a href='#f639' class='c012'><sup>[639]</sup></a> some when he was
approaching, others when he had passed, his eighth lustre. In
these three books it is probable that Horace intended all the
products of his lyric muse should be comprised: to this purpose
the last ode of the third book<a id='r640' /><a href='#f640' class='c012'><sup>[640]</sup></a> seems to point. He considered his
work done; and he was not insensible to the successful manner
in which he had accomplished it. With conscious pride, and
in a prophetic spirit, he exclaimed—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Exegi monumentum ære perennius.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>He intended his beloved friend and patron, Mæcenas, to be
the subject of his last, as he was of his first, song. His introductory
satire—the commencement of his published works—was
addressed to him; the last ode in the book<a id='r641' /><a href='#f641' class='c012'><sup>[641]</sup></a> (except that final one
which proclaims his task finished) is a noble farewell, breathing
the language of affectionate compliment;<a id='r642' /><a href='#f642' class='c012'><sup>[642]</sup></a> and in the introduction
to his new work, the labour of his maturer years, the fruit of
careful judgment respecting men and things, he states his determination
to finish his career as a poet, and to devote his last
verses to his patron.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few years after the first three books of the Odes, Horace
published the first book of the Epistles. Bentley assigns the appearance
of these finished and elaborate compositions to <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 19,
Clinton to <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 20. The <cite>Carmen Seculare</cite>, which appeared <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span>
17, on the occasion of the celebration of the Secular Games, and
the fourth book of the Odes, which was published <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 13, were
written at the personal request of the Emperor. He wished him
to celebrate the victories gained over Vindelici by his step-sons,
Tiberius and Drusus. His compliance with the wishes of Augustus
was a graceful return for the regard and affection which
the letters of the Emperor show that he felt for the poet.<a id='r643' /><a href='#f643' class='c012'><sup>[643]</sup></a> The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>warm admiration which, these odes express, the praises which
are lavished in them, upon Augustus and his step-sons Tiberius
and Drusus, may seem inconsistent with the poet’s former republicanism;
but who could withstand the proffered friendship, the
winning courtesy, the good-tempered condescension of his patron?</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides, the experience of the past years must have forced him
conscientiously to believe that the reign of Augustus was indeed
a blessing to his country, and that his countrymen were totally
unfit for real liberty, as they showed themselves quite content
with the empty shadow of the constitution. He felt peace
and repose were to be purchased by almost any sacrifice except
that of honourable principle; that not only all the enjoyments of
life were secured to himself to an extent equalling, if not surpassing,
the wishes of his contented spirit, but that a similar
measure of happiness was pretty generally diffused. He could not
sympathize with political ambition, which had been the fruitful
source of civil anarchy, and it was only the ambitious who had
any cause to be dissatisfied. Doubtless the older he grew the
stronger was the obligation which he felt to him who, by the lofty
position which he had attained, had apparently prevented even
the possibility of revolution or change. It is certain that the
second book of the Epistles, and that addressed to the Pisos,
which is commonly called the Art of Poetry, were written and
published during the last years of his life; but the date cannot
be exactly determined. He had long bid adieu to the excitements
of politics; nor do these, his latest works, exhibit traces of his
fondness for discussing questions of moral science, or for the profounder
speculations of natural philosophy. He limits himself
to the neutral ground of literature; and writes only as a writer
whose judgment would be undisputed, because his works in their
several departments had actually formed the taste of his contemporaries.</p>

<p class='c011'>In November, <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 8, <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;C.</span> 746, Horace was seized with a
sudden attack of illness, and died in the fifty-seventh year of his
age. His old friend Mæcenas had expired but a few months
before. They were buried near one another on the slope of the
Esquiline.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>His death was so sudden that he was unable to write a will;
he had but just time before he expired to nominate, according
to a common custom, the Emperor his heir.</p>

<p class='c011'>Horace was never married; he was too general an admirer,
and his tastes and habits were too much those of a bachelor, to
appreciate the happiness of a wedded life. In this respect his
feelings resembled those of the voluptuous and selfish society of
his times. He was of small and slight figure,<a id='r644' /><a href='#f644' class='c012'><sup>[644]</sup></a> but afterwards he
grew corpulent.<a id='r645' /><a href='#f645' class='c012'><sup>[645]</sup></a> The vigour which he enjoyed in early youth<a id='r646' /><a href='#f646' class='c012'><sup>[646]</sup></a>
was diminished by ill health; he became prematurely gray,<a id='r647' /><a href='#f647' class='c012'><sup>[647]</sup></a> and
a passage in one of his Odes seems to imply that he was a valetudinarian
at forty.<a id='r648' /><a href='#f648' class='c012'><sup>[648]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c010'>The life of Horace is especially instructive, as a mirror in
which is reflected a faithful image of the manners of his day.
He is the representative of Roman refined society, as Virgil is
of the national mind. He who understands Horace and his
works can picture to himself the society in which he lived and
moved. One cannot sympathize with Petrarch, when he says

<p class='c022'>but still it is scarcely possible not to feel an affection for him.
Notwithstanding his selfish Epicureanism, he possessed those
elements of character which constitute the popularity of men of
the world. He was a gentleman in taste and sentiments. He
would not have denied himself any gratification for the sake of
others; but he would not willingly have caused any one a moment’s
uneasiness, nor was he ever ungrateful to those who
were kind to him. He was a pleasant friend and a good-humoured
associate, adroit in using the language of compliment,
but not a flatterer, because he was candid and sincere. He
changed his politics, but he had good cause for so doing. The
circumstances of the times furnished ample justification. His
morals were lax, but not worse than those of his contemporaries:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>all that can be said is, that he was not in advance of his age.
His principles will not bear comparison with a high moral standard;
but he had good qualities to compensate for his moral deficiencies.
He looked at virtue and vice from a worldly, not a
moral point of view. With him the former was prudence, the
latter folly. Vice, therefore, provoked a sneer of derision, and
not indignation at the sin or compassion for the sinner; and for
the same reason he was incapable of entertaining a holy enthusiasm
for virtue.</p>

<p class='c011'>Good-tempered as a man, he nevertheless showed that he belonged
to the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">genus irritabile vatum</span></i>. He was jealous of his poetical
reputation; not, indeed, towards his contemporaries, but towards the
poets of former ages. He either could not or would
not see any merit in old Roman poetry. His prejudice cannot
be ascribed only to his enthusiasm for Greek literature, for he
did not even appreciate the excellences which the old school of
poetry had in common with the Greeks. Party spirit had somewhat
to do with it, for a feud on the subject divided the literary
society of the day,<a id='r649' /><a href='#f649' class='c012'><sup>[649]</sup></a> and hence Horace took his side warmly and
uncompromisingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the principal cause was jealousy—unless he ignored Lucilius
and Catullus, he could not claim to have been the first
follower of Archilochus of whom Rome could boast; or, as the
representative of Roman lyric poetry, to have first tuned his
lyre to Æolian song.</p>

<p class='c011'>The scenes in which Horace passed his life are so interesting
to every reader of his works, that a few words respecting his
villa at Tivoli and his Sabine farm will not be out of place here.
Tibur<a id='r650' /><a href='#f650' class='c012'><sup>[650]</sup></a> is situated on one of the spurs of the Appennines, about
fifteen or sixteen miles from Rome, on the left bank of the
Anio (Teverone.) The river winds gently by the town, separating
it from the villa of Horace, and then, falling in a sheet
of water over an escarped rock, disappears beneath a rocky
cavern. Its roaring echoes are heard far and wide, and justifies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>the epithet (<i>resonans</i>,) which Horace gives to the dwelling of
Albunea, the Tiburtine Sibyl. The villa commanded fine views,
and a garden sloped down from it to the river’s bank. From
its grounds was visible the palace of Mæcenas: on the opposite
shore the wooded Sabine hills sheltered it from the north; and
the domain of the poet’s friend, Quintilius Varus, formed its
western boundary.</p>

<p class='c011'>About fifteen miles north-east of Tibur, nestling amongst the
roots of Mount Lucretilis, lay the Sabine farm. Fragments of
white marble, and mosaic, which have been found there, show
that, notwithstanding the simple frugality which Horace delights
to describe, it was built and embellished with elegance
and taste. From the mountain side, which rises behind the
house, trickles a clear stream, the source of which is now called
Fonte Bello, and which afterwards becomes the river Digentia
(Licenza,) and waters the beautiful valley of the sloping Ustica
(<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Usticæ Cubantis</span></i>.) This rill, the parent of Horace’s favourite
river, the embellisher of that “<i>riant</i> angle of the earth,” is interesting
as being probably the fountain of Bandusia, “more
transparent than glass,”<a id='r651' /><a href='#f651' class='c012'><sup>[651]</sup></a> with whose fresh and sparkling waters
the poet tempered his wine.</p>

<p class='c011'>M. de Chaupy<a id='r652' /><a href='#f652' class='c012'><sup>[652]</sup></a> assumes that the Bandusian fountain, mentioned
by Horace, was situated near the birthplace of Horace, on
the Lucano-Apulian border. His opinion rests on the words
of a grant made by Pope Pascal II. to the abbot of the Bantine
monastery; and Mr. Hobhouse<a id='r653' /><a href='#f653' class='c012'><sup>[653]</sup></a> considers this document as decisive
in ascertaining its position. It is decisive as to the existence
of a Bandusian fountain near Venusia; but it must be remembered
that Horace never saw it after the days of his childhood,
when his paternal estate passed away from him for ever,
whilst he speaks of his Bandusian fountain as near him, when
he writes, and promises to sacrifice a kid to the guardian genius
of the spring. What, then, is more probable than the suggestion
of Mr. Dunlop,<a id='r654' /><a href='#f654' class='c012'><sup>[654]</sup></a> that the same pleasing recollections of his
early years, which inspired him to relate his touching adventure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>led him to “name the clearest and loveliest stream of his Sabine
retreat after that fountain which lay in Apulia, and on the
brink of which he had no doubt often sported in infancy?”<a id='r655' /><a href='#f655' class='c012'><sup>[655]</sup></a>
He has in one of his odes alluded to this affectionate desire to
perpetuate reminiscences of home—a desire which is illustrated
by the topographical nomenclature which has been adopted by
colonists of every age and country.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Dennis, however, in a letter written at Licenza,<a id='r656' /><a href='#f656' class='c012'><sup>[656]</sup></a> in sight
of the pleasant shades of M. Lucretilis, although he makes no
doubt of the Bandusian fountain being in the neighbourhood,
does not identify it with the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fonte Bello</span>.” He asserts that,
although he has traced every streamlet in the neighbourhood,
the only one which answers to the classical description is one
now called “Fonte Blandusia.” It rises in a narrow glen which
divides the Mount Lucretilis from Ustica, which probably derives
its modern name <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Valle Rustica</span></i> from a corruption of the
classical appellation. As you ascend the glen it contracts into
a ravine with bare cliffs on either side; the streamlet with difficulty
winds its way between mossy rocks (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">musco circumlita saxa</span></i>,)
overshadowed with dense woods which effectually exclude the
heat of the blazing Dog-star. The water issues from a rock,
and trickles into two successive natural basins. “The water is
indeed <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">splendidior vitro</span></i>; nothing, not even the Thracian Hebrus,
can exceed it in purity, coolness, and sweetness: ‘its loquacious
waters still bubble;’ the very ilices still overhang the hollow
rocks whence it springs.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A reference to Horace’s description<a id='r657' /><a href='#f657' class='c012'><sup>[657]</sup></a> will prove to the modern
traveller through this classic region with what fidelity and accuracy
the poet has described the natural features of the scenery.
The mountain chain is continuous and unbroken (<i>continui
montes</i>,) save by the well wooded and therefore shady valley of
the Digentia, which intersects it in such a direction that—</p>

manners and the fashionable novel. They are much more appropriately
described by the title <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sermones</span></cite> (Discourses) which
is also given to them. They are, in fact, desultory didactic essays,
in which the topics are discussed just as they present themselves.
In them is sketched boldly but good-humouredly a picture
of Roman social life with its vices and follies. His object

<p class='c022'>There is nothing of the political bitterness of Lucilius,<a id='r662' /><a href='#f662' class='c012'><sup>[662]</sup></a> the
love of purity and honour which adorns Persius, or the burning
indignation which Juvenal pours forth at the loathsome corruption
of morals. Horace had been a politician and a warm champion
of liberty; but the struggle was now over, both with himself
and his country. Ease and tranquillity were insured to
both by the new régime; and his contented temper disposed him
to acquiesce in a state of things which gave Rome time to rest
from the horrors of civil war, and did not interfere with the independence
of the individual. Hence the circumstances of the
times, as well as his own temper, rendered his satires social and
not political. Lucilius wrote when the strife between nobles
and people was still raging, and the latter had not as yet succumbed.
He, therefore, breathed the spirit of the old Athenian
comic poets whom he followed and emulated; and the war
of public opinion furnished him with topics similar to those
which were discussed in the republican commonwealth of
Athens.</p>

<p class='c011'>Circumstances also influenced, in some degree, the tone of
Horace’s strictures on the habits of social life. Immoral as society
was, its most salient features were luxury, frivolity, extravagance,
and effeminacy. Vice had not reached that appalling
height which it attained in the time of the emperor who succeeded
Augustus. Deficient in moral purity, an Epicurean and
a debauchee, nothing would strike him as deserving censure, except
such success as would actually defeat the object which he
proposed to himself—namely, the utmost enjoyment of life.
The dictates of prudence, therefore, would be his highest standard
and his strongest check. He saw that public morals were
already deteriorated, and threatened to become worse; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>though they were bad enough to provoke derision, they did not
shock or revolt one who was, and who professed to be, a man of
the world. Had Horace lived in the time of Persius or Lucilius,
even his satire would probably have been pointed and
severe.</p>

<p class='c011'>Often his satires are only accidentally didactic; he contents
himself with graphic delineations of character and manners, and
leaves them to produce their own moral effect upon the reader.
In one<a id='r663' /><a href='#f663' class='c012'><sup>[663]</sup></a> he holds up the superstition of the Romans to ridicule
by a minute narrative of the absurd ceremonies performed
by Canidia and another sorceress in their incantations. In
another,<a id='r664' /><a href='#f664' class='c012'><sup>[664]</sup></a> amusingly describes the annoyance to which he was
exposed by the importunities of a gossiping trifler. In the
journey to Brundisium he seems to have had no view beyond
entertainment; although two incidents give him an opportunity
of exposing the pomposity of a municipal official and the superstitious
follies of a country town.<a id='r665' /><a href='#f665' class='c012'><sup>[665]</sup></a> In others, his subjects are
the scenery and neighbouring society of his Sabine valley;<a id='r666' /><a href='#f666' class='c012'><sup>[666]</sup></a> the
way in which he is wont to spend his day when at Rome; his
own autobiography;<a id='r667' /><a href='#f667' class='c012'><sup>[667]</sup></a> a laughable trial in Asia;<a id='r668' /><a href='#f668' class='c012'><sup>[668]</sup></a> an essay on
cookery;<a id='r669' /><a href='#f669' class='c012'><sup>[669]</sup></a> and a candid exposure of his own faults and inconsistencies.
Not that he is forgetful of his moral duties as a
satirist. He exposes to merited contempt the prevailing iniquities
of the day. The meanness of legacy-hunting; the absurdity
of pretension and foppery; the folly of an inordinate passion for
amassing wealth;<a id='r670' /><a href='#f670' class='c012'><sup>[670]</sup></a> the dangers of adultery;<a id='r671' /><a href='#f671' class='c012'><sup>[671]</sup></a> the unfairness of
uncharitably misinterpreting the conduct of others.<a id='r672' /><a href='#f672' class='c012'><sup>[672]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Such are the varied subjects contained in the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sermones</span></cite> or
Satires of Horace. The Epistles are still more desultory and
unrestrained. Epistolary writing is especially a Roman accomplishment.
The Romans thought their correspondents deserved
that as much pains should be bestowed on that which
was addressed to them as on that which was intended for the
public eye; and, in addition to the careful polish of which Cicero
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>set the example, Horace brought to the task the embellishment
of poetry. In the Epistles, he lays aside the character of a
moral teacher or censor. He treats his correspondent as an
equal. He opens his heart unreservedly: he gives advice, but
in a kind and gentle spirit, not with sneering severity. The
satire is delivered <i>ex cathedrâ</i>;—the epistle with the freedom
with which he would converse with an intimate friend.</p>

<p class='c011'>The subjects of the first books are moral, those of the second
critical. The <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ars Poetica</span></cite> is but a poetical epistle addressed to
the Pisos, who had been bitten by the prevailing mania for tragic
poetry. The usual title claims a far greater extent of subject
than the poet intended. It is not a treatise on poetry, but
simply an outline of the history of the Greek drama, and the
principles of criticism applicable to it. It harmonizes well with
the literary subjects treated of in the second book of the Epistles,
and might well be included in it. It is, indeed, longer and more
elaborate: a synopsis of so extensive a subject required more
careful treatment; but it is impossible to form a correct estimate
of the taste and judgment which it displays, unless it is considered
as nothing more than an epistle.</p>

<p class='c011'>The versification of these compositions is more smooth than
that of the Satires, but only in proportion to the superior neatness
of the style generally. In neither does the metrical harmony
rise to the height of poetry, properly speaking. Doubtless
this was the poet’s deliberate intention. It cannot be supposed
that he who could so successfully introduce all the beautiful
Greek lyric metres, and in some cases improve the delicacy of
their structure, was incapable of reproducing the rhythm of the
Greek hexameter. He felt that in subjects belonging to the
prosaic realities of life, and hitherto treated with the conversational
facility of the iambic measure, some appearance of negligence
and even roughness could alone render the stately hexameter
appropriate, and therefore tolerable. But, admirable as
the Satires are for their artistic and dramatic power, and the
Epistles for their correct taste, lively wit, and critical elegance,
it is in his inimitable Odes that the genius of Horace as a poet
is especially displayed. They have never been equalled in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>beauty of sentiment, gracefulness of language, and melody of
versification. They comprehend every variety of subject suitable
to the lyric muse. They rise without effort to the most elevated
topics—the grandest subjects of history, the most gorgeous legends
of mythology, the noblest aspirations of patriotism: they
descend to the simplest joys and sorrows of every-day life. At
one time they burn with indignation, at another they pour forth
accents of the tenderest emotions. They present in turn every
phase of the author’s character: some remind us that he was a
philosopher and a satirist; and although many are sensuous and
self-indulgent, they are full of gentleness, kindness, and spirituality.
Not only do they evince a complete mastery over the
Greek metres, but also show that Horace was thoroughly imbued
with the spirit of Greek poetry, and had profoundly studied
Greek literature, especially the writings of Pindar and the lyric
poets. Numerous as the instances are in which he has imitated
them, and introduced by a happy adaptation their ideas, epithets,
and phrases, his imitations are not mere plagiarisms or purple
patches—they are made so completely his own, and are invested
with so much novelty and originality, that, when compared with
the original, we receive additional gratification from discovering
the resemblance. The sentiments which are paraphrased seem
improved: the expressions which are translated seem so appropriate,
and harmonize so exactly with the context, that a poet,
whose memory was stored with them, would have been guilty of
bad taste if he had substituted any others. Greek feelings,
sentiments, and imagery, are so naturally amalgamated with
Roman manners, that they seem to have undergone a transmigration,
and to animate a Roman form. The following are some
of the most striking parallelisms:<a id='r673' /><a href='#f673' class='c012'><sup>[673]</sup></a>—</p>

<p class='c018'>In a literary history it is impossible to omit some account of
one, who, although his attempts at poetry were very contemptible,
exercised, by his good taste and munificence, a great influence
upon literature, and to whom the literary men of Rome were
much indebted for the use which he made of his confidential
friendship with Augustus.</p>

<p class='c011'>C. Cilnius Mæcenas was a member of an equestrian family,
which, though it derived its descent from the old Etruscan kings,<a id='r675' /><a href='#f675' class='c012'><sup>[675]</sup></a>
does not appear to have produced any distinguished individuals.
His birth-year is unknown, but his birth-day was the ides (13th)
of April.<a id='r676' /><a href='#f676' class='c012'><sup>[676]</sup></a> We have no information respecting the origin of his
intimacy with Augustus. Probably his cultivated taste, his extensive
acquaintance with Greek and Roman literature, his imperturbable
temper, and love of pleasure, first recommended
him as an agreeable companion to Octavius.</p>

<p class='c011'>His good sense, activity, and energy in business, and decisive
character, qualities in which his irresolute and desultory patron
was signally deficient, enabled him rapidly to improve the acquaintance
into intimacy. It is said by Dion Cassius<a id='r677' /><a href='#f677' class='c012'><sup>[677]</sup></a> that Augustus
obtained from Mæcenas a complete plan for the internal
administration of his newly-acquired empire, and that in it were
displayed sound judgment and political wisdom. It is probable
that there is some exaggeration in this statement; but that, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>being a great man, he was in these respects a greater man
than Augustus, who, therefore, when he required his support,
could lean upon him with safety. And yet his weaknesses were
such as to prevent any feeling of jealousy, or appearance of superiority,
from endangering his friendship with the emperor. His
love of pleasure, and of the quiet and careless enjoyments of a
private station, proved, as it turned out, a blessing to his country.
His heart was so full of the delights of refined and intellectual
society—of palaces and gardens, and wit and poetry, and collections
of art and virtû—that there was no room in it for ambition.
His careless and sauntering indolence was openly displayed
in his lounging gait, and his toga trailing on the ground.
No one could possibly suspect such a loiterer of sufficient energy
or application to be a politician and an intriguer. Such being
his character, tastes, and habits, he felt no temptation to abuse
his influence with Augustus. He did not covet honours and office,
because he knew they must bring trouble and distraction, perhaps
peril with them. He exercised his power, which was undoubtedly
great, to promote that luxurious, yet refined elegance,
in which he himself delighted, and to secure the welfare of his
literary friends. He had wealth enough to gratify his utmost
wishes. Augustus, therefore, had nothing more to confer on him
which he valued, except personal esteem and regard.</p>

<p class='c011'>The confidence which the Emperor reposed in him is shown by
his employing him in some affairs of great delicacy: first, in arranging
a marriage with Scribonia; and, subsequently, on two
occasions, in negotiating with Antony.<a id='r678' /><a href='#f678' class='c012'><sup>[678]</sup></a> In <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 36, he accompanied
Octavius into Sicily; but was sent back in order to undertake
the administration of Rome and Italy;<a id='r679' /><a href='#f679' class='c012'><sup>[679]</sup></a> and during the campaign
at Actium,<a id='r680' /><a href='#f680' class='c012'><sup>[680]</sup></a> Mæcenas was again vicegerent, in which capacity
he crushed the conspiracy of the younger Lepidus. So
unlimited was his power, that he was even intrusted with the
signet of Octavius, and with authority to open, and even to alter,
if necessary, all letters which he wrote to the senate during his
campaign; and when the victorious general, on his return to
Rome, consulted with him and Agrippa as to the expediency of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>re-establishing the republic, Mæcenas, in opposition to the recommendation
of Agrippa, dissuaded him from taking that step.
The moral influence also of Mæcenas over Augustus is very
striking. So long as it continued, we see nothing of that heartless
cruelty, that disregard of the happiness of others, which deformed
the early life of the Emperor: if he was heartless, he at
least did that as a matter of taste which a better man would have
done on principle; and if he was still selfish, he sought fame and
glory by the wise counsels of peace rather than by the brilliant
triumphs of war: he conciliated friends instead of crushing
enemies.</p>

<p class='c011'>The intimacy between Mæcenas and the Emperor continued
for at least ten years after the battle of Actium: then an estrangement
commenced; and in <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 16, he was deprived of his official
position, and Taurus was intrusted with the administration of
Rome and Italy. Scandalous stories have been told about his
wife Terentia and the Emperor, in order to account for the interruption
of their intimacy; but no special causes are necessary
to account for an event so common. The words of Tacitus<a id='r681' /><a href='#f681' class='c012'><sup>[681]</sup></a> are
a sufficient solution of the problem:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Idque et Mæcenati acciderat;
fato potentiæ, raro sempiternæ, an satias capit, aut illos,
cum omnia tribuerunt, aut hos, cum jam nihil reliquum est, quod
cupiant</span>.” He retained the outward appearance of the imperial
friendship, although he had lost the reality. He went to court
on the birth-day, but ceased to be of the Emperor’s council. His
life was passed in the voluptuous retirement of his palace on the
Esquiline, which he had built for himself. This hill was not
generally considered wholesome: probably the fact that it had
been a burial-ground<a id='r682' /><a href='#f682' class='c012'><sup>[682]</sup></a> created a prejudice against it; but the
loftiness of the site chosen, as well as of the building itself (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">molem
vicinam nubibus</span></i>,) and the breeze which played freely through
the lovely garden with which it was surrounded, rendered it
salubrious. All the most brilliant society of Rome was found
at his table; and many of the best of them received still more
substantial marks of his favour.<a id='r683' /><a href='#f683' class='c012'><sup>[683]</sup></a> Virgil, Horace, Propertius,
and Varius, were amongst his friends and constant associates.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>Mæcenas was a low-spirited invalid;<a id='r684' /><a href='#f684' class='c012'><sup>[684]</sup></a> latterly he could not sleep,
and endeavoured in vain to procure repose by listening to soft
music.<a id='r685' /><a href='#f685' class='c012'><sup>[685]</sup></a> In his last distressing illness he generally resided at his
Tiburtine villa, where the murmuring falls of the Anio invited
that sleep which was denied him elsewhere. He died <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 8, and
was buried on the Esquiline. Though married, he left no children,
and bequeathed his property to the Emperor, whom he besought
in his will not to forget his beloved Horace. His taste
as a critic was evidently far superior to his talents as a writer.
Few fragments of his writings remain; and all ancient critics
are unanimous in the condemnation of his style. Augustus<a id='r686' /><a href='#f686' class='c012'><sup>[686]</sup></a>
laughed at his affected jargon of mingled Etruscan and Latin.
Quintilian<a id='r687' /><a href='#f687' class='c012'><sup>[687]</sup></a> quotes instances of his absurd inversions and transpositions;
and Seneca<a id='r688' /><a href='#f688' class='c012'><sup>[688]</sup></a> shows, by an example, its unintelligible obscurity.<a id='r689' /><a href='#f689' class='c012'><sup>[689]</sup></a>
He was a sensualist and a voluptuary,<a id='r690' /><a href='#f690' class='c012'><sup>[690]</sup></a> and an unfaithful
husband; and yet he was devotedly fond of his wife, the beautiful
but ill-tempered Terentia, who had a great influence over him.
He would divorce her one day only to restore her to conjugal
rights on the next; and Seneca said that, though he had only
one wife, he was married a thousand times. He abhorred cruelty
and severity, and would not let it pass unrebuked even in the
Emperor; and although he made a boast of effeminacy, he was
ready to devote himself heartily to business in cases of emergency.
In fact, he was a fair specimen of the man of pleasure and society:
liberal, kind-hearted, clever, refined, but luxurious, self-indulgent,
indolent, and volatile, with good instincts and impulses, but
without principle.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>C. Valgius Rufus.</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Amongst the poets of the Augustan age, whose writings were
much admired by their contemporaries, but have not stood the
searching test of time, was Valgius Rufus. Of his life no records
remain; but he probably belonged to that class of authors of
whom Pliny says, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quibus nos in vehiculo, in balneo, inter cœnam,
oblectamus otium temporis</span>.”<a id='r691' /><a href='#f691' class='c012'><sup>[691]</sup></a> They were light and pleasing,
calculated to amuse an idle half-hour, or to relieve the tedium
of a journey. They answered the purpose of the railroad literature
of our own days. These writers had a correct taste, and
a critical discernment of poetical beauty, rather than a genius
for poetical composition. Probably their personal characters
had something to do with their reputation: they were members
of a literary <i>coterie</i>; they lived, thought, and felt together; they
defended each other against malicious criticism; and the bonds
of friendship by which they were united tempted the greater
poets to regard their effusions with kind but undue partiality.
Valgius Rufus was a great favourite of Horace,<a id='r692' /><a href='#f692' class='c012'><sup>[692]</sup></a> but only a few
short, isolated passages are extant of his poems.<a id='r693' /><a href='#f693' class='c012'><sup>[693]</sup></a> Quintilian<a id='r694' /><a href='#f694' class='c012'><sup>[694]</sup></a>
attributes to him a translation of the rhetorical precepts of
Apollodorus. Seneca<a id='r695' /><a href='#f695' class='c012'><sup>[695]</sup></a> mentions him by name: Pliny<a id='r696' /><a href='#f696' class='c012'><sup>[696]</sup></a> praises
his erudition. The testimony borne to his transcendent merits
as an epic poet, in the Panegyric of Messala, need scarcely be
trusted, because it is almost certain that this piece is spurious.<a id='r697' /><a href='#f697' class='c012'><sup>[697]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Varius.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Of L. Varius Rufus also, who was one of the constant guests
at Mæcenas’ table, scarcely any thing is known. Horace<a id='r698' /><a href='#f698' class='c012'><sup>[698]</sup></a> tells
us that he was unequalled in epic song, when Virgil had as yet
only turned his attention to rustic poetry. The high praise
bestowed upon his Thyestes by Quintilian has already been
mentioned. To him, together with Virgil, we have seen that
Horace owed his introduction to Augustus, and all three were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>of the party which accompanied Mæcenas to Brundisium. The
titles of two of his poems are extant,—I. <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Morte</span></cite>; II. <cite>Panegyric
on Augustus</cite>. Of the former, four fragments are preserved
by Macrobius, all of which Virgil has deemed worthy of imitation.
Of the latter, two lines, containing a delicate compliment
to Augustus, are extant, which Horace has introduced entire
into one of his Epistles.<a id='r699' /><a href='#f699' class='c012'><sup>[699]</sup></a> The passage by no means satisfies
modern taste, which has been formed by the hexametrical rhythm
of Virgil; but Seneca praises his style as free from the usual
faults of Latin declamatory poetry—mere bombast on the one
hand, and excessive minuteness on the other. Niebuhr conjectures
that his Thyestes was too declamatory; and that, like the
later Roman tragedies of Seneca and others, it was not an imitation
of the Attic drama, but of the degenerate tragedies belonging
to the Alexandrian period.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>C. Cornelius Gallus</span> (<span class='fss'>BORN B. C.</span> 66 or 69.)</h4>

<p class='c018'>Gallus was more distinguished as a general than as a poet.
Except a single line from one of his elegies, not a vestige of his
poetry remains; for the short pieces attributed to him<a id='r700' /><a href='#f700' class='c012'><sup>[700]</sup></a> are undoubtedly
not genuine. He owes his fame, probably, to the kind
verdict of his contemporaries, whose friendship and amiable
affection for each other appear never to have been endangered
by the slightest spark of jealousy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Born at Frejus, of low parentage, he was a fellow-student in
philosophy with Virgil<a id='r701' /><a href='#f701' class='c012'><sup>[701]</sup></a> and Arius—a friendship thus commenced
which continued through life. The patronage of Asinius Pollio<a id='r702' /><a href='#f702' class='c012'><sup>[702]</sup></a>
brought him into notice as a poet at the early age of twenty.
He was one of the first to attach himself to the cause of Octavius;
and, being appointed commissioner for allotting the lands to the
military colonies, he had the opportunity of befriending Virgil
and the plundered Mantuans. At Actium he commanded a brigade,
burnt Antony’s ships in the harbour of Parætonium, was
one of the capturers of Cleopatra, and was rewarded by Octavius
with being made first prefect of Egypt. How so valuable a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>servant lost the Emperor’s favour is uncertain. Ovid hints that
his crime was one of words, not of deeds:—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Linguam nimio non tenuisse mero.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c022'>He was recalled, his property confiscated, and himself exiled.
He had not strength of mind to bear his fall, and he committed
suicide in the forty-first or forty-third year of his age.<a id='r703' /><a href='#f703' class='c012'><sup>[703]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>No judgment respecting his merits can be formed from the
contradictory criticism of the ancients. Ovid awards to him the
palm among the elegiac poets,<a id='r704' /><a href='#f704' class='c012'><sup>[704]</sup></a> and Virgil is said to have sung
his praises in his fourth Georgic, but afterwards to have omitted
the passage and substituted for it the story of Aristæus; whilst
Quintilian<a id='r705' /><a href='#f705' class='c012'><sup>[705]</sup></a> applies the epithet <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">durior</span></i> to his versification. Perhaps
the latter attached too much importance to the grace and
sweetness of diction, but neglected the beauty of the sentiments;
whilst the former might have been too partial in his sympathy
with a fellow exile. He was the author of four books of elegies,
in which, under the feigned name of Lycoris, he sings his love
for his mistress Cytheris. He also translated the Greek poems
of Euphorion.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Albius Tibullus.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Tibullus was born of an equestrian family, probably in <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span>
54. He was a contemporary of Virgil and Horace;<a id='r706' /><a href='#f706' class='c012'><sup>[706]</sup></a> and like
them, during the troubles of the civil wars, suffered the confiscation
of his paternal estate, which was situated at Pedum, near
Tibur. After the conclusion of the struggle a portion was restored
to him—small, indeed, but sufficient to satisfy his moderate
wants and contented disposition.</p>

<p class='c011'>Disinclined, as well by his love of quiet, to the labours and
perils of a military life, as he was by the tenderness and softness
of his character to the horrors of war, circumstances, nevertheless,
forced him involuntarily to undertake a campaign. Messala
was his patron, to whom he was evidently under great obligations.<a id='r707' /><a href='#f707' class='c012'><sup>[707]</sup></a>
When, therefore, he was sent by Octavia to quell an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>insurrection in Aquitania, Tibullus accompanied him. This
campaign and the successes of Messala furnished the poet with
subjects for his muse.<a id='r708' /><a href='#f708' class='c012'><sup>[708]</sup></a> Tibullus also fully intended to continue
his services to Messala in the east, during the following year;
but illness compelled him to stop at Corcyra, whence he returned
to Rome.<a id='r709' /><a href='#f709' class='c012'><sup>[709]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The mistresses whose beauty, inconstancy, and cruelty Tibullus
celebrates in his elegies were, unlike those of Horace, real persons.
Delia’s real name is said to have been Plautia or Plania;<a id='r710' /><a href='#f710' class='c012'><sup>[710]</sup></a>
who Nemesis was is not known. These are the only two mentioned
by himself or alluded to by Ovid;<a id='r711' /><a href='#f711' class='c012'><sup>[711]</sup></a> but Horace addresses
an ode to him on his passion for a mistress whom he names Glycera.
Probably he is speaking of one of Tibullus’ mistresses
under a feigned name, in accordance with his habitual practice,
for the names introduced by him in his poems, generally speaking,
bear no appearance of reality. They are, with very few exceptions,
suggested by his study of Greek lyric poets. Chloris,
Lycoris, Neobule, Lydia, Thaliarchus, Xanthias, Pholoe, are all
Greek characters, translated to Roman scenes, and made to play
an artificial part in Roman life. Cinara<a id='r712' /><a href='#f712' class='c012'><sup>[712]</sup></a> was, perhaps, a real
person, as Bassus, the Novii Mævius, and Numida, undoubtedly
are. Sometimes, when his object is satire, he speaks of the
subject of his irony under a name somewhat resembling the real
one; as, for example, when he ridicules Mæcenas under the
name of Malthinus,<a id='r713' /><a href='#f713' class='c012'><sup>[713]</sup></a> Salvidianus Rufus under that of Nasidianus,<a id='r714' /><a href='#f714' class='c012'><sup>[714]</sup></a>
and lampoons Gratidia the sorceress as Canidia. But in the
poetry of Tibullus, as in that of Catullus and Propertius, the
same names are found in each of a series of poems. Apuleius<a id='r715' /><a href='#f715' class='c012'><sup>[715]</sup></a>
asserts that the real name of the Lesbia of Catullus was Clodia;
that of the Cynthia of Propertius, Hostia, and that she was a
native of Tivoli.</p>

<p class='c011'>The style and tone of thought of Tibullus are, like his character,
deficient in vigour and manliness, but sweet, smooth, polished,
tender, and never disfigured by bad taste. He does not deserve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>the censure of Niebuhr, who stigmatizes him as a “disagreeable
poet, because of his doleful and weeping melancholy and sentimentality,
resulting from misunderstanding the ancient elegies
of Mimnermus.”<a id='r716' /><a href='#f716' class='c012'><sup>[716]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>After his return from Corcyra, Tibullus passed the remainder
of his short life in the peaceful retirement of his paternal estate.
He died young, shortly after Virgil, if we may trust to an epigram,
ascribed to Domitius Marsus, contained in the Latin Anthologia:<a id='r717' /><a href='#f717' class='c012'><sup>[717]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Te quoque Virgilio comitem non æqua, Tibulle,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Mors juvenem campos misit in Elysios,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ne foret, aut elegis molles qui fleret amores,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Aut caneret forti regia bella pede.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The poems commonly ascribed to Tibullus consist of four
books, but only two are genuine, and of these, the second was
published posthumously. Two lines in the third book, which
fix the date of the poet’s birth in the consulship of Hirtius and
Pansa,<a id='r718' /><a href='#f718' class='c012'><sup>[718]</sup></a> have generally been considered as spurious, because such
a date is inconsistent with the rest of the chronology; but Voss
rejected the whole of that book; and there is no question but
that the spirit and character of the elegies, as well as the harmony
of the metre, are very inferior to those of the preceding
poems. The same inferiority marks the fourth also, with the
exception of the smaller poems, which bear the names of Sulpicia
and Corinthus. These, as Niebuhr correctly observes, display
greater energy and boldness than Tibullus possessed, and are
the productions of some poet much superior to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>That elegant scholar and judicious critic, Muretus,<a id='r719' /><a href='#f719' class='c012'><sup>[719]</sup></a> has well
attributed to him, as his chief characteristics, simplicity, and
natural and unaffected genius:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Illum (<i>i. e.</i> Tibullum) judices
<i>simplicius</i> scripsisse quæ cogitaret; hunc (<i>i. e.</i> Propertium)
diligentius cogitasse quæ scriberet. In illo <i>plus naturæ</i>, in hoc
plus curæ atque industriæ perspicias.</span>”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sextus Aurelius Propertius.</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Very little is known respecting the life and personal history
of Propertius beyond the few facts which may be gleaned from
his poems. He was a native of the border country of Umbria,
and was probably born not earlier than <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;C.</span> 703,<a id='r720' /><a href='#f720' class='c012'><sup>[720]</sup></a> or later
than 700.<a id='r721' /><a href='#f721' class='c012'><sup>[721]</sup></a> This period will sufficiently agree with the statement
of Ovid respecting their relative ages.<a id='r722' /><a href='#f722' class='c012'><sup>[722]</sup></a> His family had not
produced any distinguished member, but possessed a competent
estate. Like Virgil and Tibullus, he was a sufferer by the consequences
of war; for the establishment of a military colony
reduced him from comfort to straitened circumstances.<a id='r723' /><a href='#f723' class='c012'><sup>[723]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Like most young Romans of genius and education, he was
intended for the bar;<a id='r724' /><a href='#f724' class='c012'><sup>[724]</sup></a> but poetry had greater charms for him
than severe studies, and he became nothing more than a literary
man. He inhabited a house in the now fashionable quarter of
the Esquiline, and was on intimate terms with Gallus, Ovid,
Bassus, and Virgil. Cynthia, his amour with whom inspired so
large a portion of his elegies, was not only a beautiful but an
accomplished woman. She was his first love; and it appears to
have been some time before she yielded to his solicitations,<a id='r725' /><a href='#f725' class='c012'><sup>[725]</sup></a> nor
was she even then always faithful to him.<a id='r726' /><a href='#f726' class='c012'><sup>[726]</sup></a> She could write
verses and play upon the lyre,<a id='r727' /><a href='#f727' class='c012'><sup>[727]</sup></a> and was a graceful dancer.<a id='r728' /><a href='#f728' class='c012'><sup>[728]</sup></a> She
owed to him, says Martial, her immortality; whilst he owed to
his love for her the inspiration which immortalized himself:—</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The date of the poet’s death is unknown, but the probability
is that he died young.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although Propertius was a contemporary and friend of the
Augustan poets, he may be considered as belonging to a somewhat
different school of poetry. His taste, like theirs, was educated
by a study of Greek literature; but the Greek poets whose
works he took for his model belonged to a later age. Horace,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>Virgil and Tibullus imitated and tried to rival the Greek classical
poets of the noblest ages: they transferred into their native
tongue the ideas of Homer, Pindar, and the old lyric poets.
Their taste was formed after the purest and most perfect models.
Propertius, on the other hand, was content with a lower flight.
He attempted nothing more than to imitate the graceful but

Callimachus or Philetas.<a id='r729' /><a href='#f729' class='c012'><sup>[729]</sup></a> Roman perseverance in the pursuit
of learning, and the spirit of investigation in the wide field of
Greek literature, had raised up this new standard of taste, which
was by no means an improvement upon that which had been
hitherto established.</p>

<p class='c011'>The imitations of Propertius are too studied and apparent to
permit him to lay claim to great natural genius. Nature alone
could give the touching tenderness of Tibullus or the facility of
Ovid—in both of which, notwithstanding his grace and elegance,
he is deficient. The absence of original fancy is concealed by
minute attention to the outward form of the poetry which he
admired. His pentameters are often inharmonious, because they
adopt so continually the Greek rules of construction; awkward
Greek idioms, and a studious display of his learning, which was
undoubtedly great, destroy that greatest charm of style, perspicuity.</p>

<p class='c011'>According to Quintilian,<a id='r730' /><a href='#f730' class='c012'><sup>[730]</sup></a> the critics of his day somewhat
overrated his merits, for they could scarcely decide the question
of superiority between him and Tibullus. This, however, is to
be expected in an age of affected rhetoric and grammatical pedantry,
when nothing was considered beautiful in poetry except
that which was in accordance with the arbitrary rules of cold
criticism. They appreciated his correctness, and did not miss
the warm heart of his rival. His poetry is not so polluted with
indelicacy as that of Ovid, but still it is often sensual and licentious.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is worthy of remark that the fourth elegy of the third book,
entitled “<cite class='quote'>Arethusa to Lycotas</cite>,” deprives Ovid of the credit of
being the inventor of the elegiac epistle.</p>

<p class='c018'>The poem of Æmilius Macer is only known through two

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Ovidius Naso</span> (<span class='fss'>BORN B. C.</span> 43.)</h4>

<p class='c018'>Ovid, as he himself states,<a id='r732' /><a href='#f732' class='c012'><sup>[732]</sup></a> was born at Sulmo (Sulmone,) a town
of the Peligni (Abruzzi,) ninety miles distant from Rome. The
year of his birth was that in which the consuls Hirtius and Pansa
fell in the field of Mutina (Modena.) His family was equestrian,
and had been so for some generations. His father lived to the
age of ninety; and, as his mother was then alive, it is probable
that she also attained an advanced age. He had a brother exactly
twelve months older than himself. Their common birthday
was the first of the Quinquatria, or festival of Minerva
(March 20th.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Whilst still of tender age the two boys were sent to Rome for
education, and placed under the care of eminent instructors.
The elder studied eloquence, and was brought up to the bar:
but he died at the early age of twenty. Ovid himself also, for
a time, studied rhetoric under Arellius Fuscus and Porcius Latro,
and the results of his study are visible in his poems;<a id='r733' /><a href='#f733' class='c012'><sup>[733]</sup></a> for example,
in the speeches of Ajax and Ulysses.<a id='r734' /><a href='#f734' class='c012'><sup>[734]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Seneca has left an interesting account of his rhetorical powers.<a id='r735' /><a href='#f735' class='c012'><sup>[735]</sup></a>
“I remember,” he says, “hearing Naso declaim, in the presence
of Arellius Fuscus, of whom he was a pupil; for he was an admirer
of Latro, although his style was different from his own.
The style of Ovid could at that time be termed nothing else but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>poetry in prose: still he was so diligent as to transfer many of
his sentiments into his verses. Latro had said—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<p class='c022'>He borrowed another idea from one of Latro’s Suasorian orations:—</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c022'>When he was a student he was thought to declaim well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>On the affecting theme of a husband and wife, who had mutually
sworn not to survive each other, Seneca asserts that he
surpassed his master in wit and talent, and was only inferior in
the arrangement of his topics. He then quotes a long passage,
in which Ovid analyzes the principles of love, with a skill and
ingenuity well worthy of one who, as a poet, made love the subject
of his song, and with a purity of sentiment which, it were
to be wished, had dignified the sweetness of his verses. Ovid
preferred <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">suasoriæ</span></i> and ethical themes to <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">controversiæ</span></i>;<a id='r736' /><a href='#f736' class='c012'><sup>[736]</sup></a> for all argument
was irksome to him. In oratory he was very careful in
the use of his words: in his poetry he was aware of his faults,
but loved them too well to correct them. He then adds the following
amusing and characteristic anecdote:—Being once asked
by his friends to erase three lines, he consented on condition that
he himself should be at liberty to make an exception in favour
of three. He accordingly wrote down three which he wished to
preserve; his friends those which they wished to erase. The papers
were examined, and both were found to contain the same
verses. Pedo Albinovanus used to say that one of these was—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c022'>Hence it is apparent that judgment was not wanting, but the
inclination to correct. He defended himself by saying that an
occasional mole is an improver of beauty. The former of these
miserable conceits is not now to be found in his poems. The
latter occurs in the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Amores</span></cite>, but it is usually read—</p>

<p class='c011'>The father of Ovid, who took a utilitarian view of life, is said
to have discouraged the cultivation of his poetical talents, and
to have stigmatized the service of the Muses as barren and unprofitable.
Even Homer himself, he was wont to say, left no
property behind him. Ovid endeavoured to comply with his father’s
wishes; he deserted Helicon, and tried to write plain prose.
It was all in vain; his words spontaneously flowed into numbers,
and whatever he tried to say was poetry. His natural genius
and facility displayed itself when he was quite a boy; for he had
not yet put on the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">toga virilis</span></i>. When he assumed this badge
of mature age, it was bordered with a broad purple stripe, which
marked the patrician order; but being unambitious and indolent,
he never took his seat in the senate, although he filled several
magisterial and judicial offices.</p>

<p class='c011'>His rank, fortune, and talents enabled him to cultivate the
society of men of congenial tastes. He became acquainted with
the best poets of his day. Macer and Propertius would recite
their compositions to him. Ponticus and Bassus were guests
at his table. He had heard the lyrics of Horace read by himself.
Virgil he had only seen; and the untimely death of Tibullus
prevented him from making the acquaintance of that poet.
He was extremely young when his juvenile poems became very
popular, and he wrote far more than he published; for he burnt
whatever displeased him; and, when sentenced to exile, in disgust
he committed the Metamorphoses to the flames.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>He himself confesses his natural susceptibility and amorous
temperament; but claims the credit of never having given occasion
to any scandal. He was three times married. His first
wife was unsuitable, and proved unworthy of him, and accordingly
he divorced her. His second he divorced also, although
no imputation rested on her virtue. From his third, whom, notwithstanding
his fickleness and infidelity, he sincerely loved,
he was only separated by exile. She was one of the Fabian family,
and bore him one daughter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Epicurean in his tastes, and a skeptic, if not a disbeliever in a
future state, he lived a life of continual self-indulgence and intrigue.
He was a universal admirer and as universal a favourite
among the female sex in the voluptuous capital; for the tone of
female morals was in that age low and depraved, and the women
encouraged the licentiousness of the men. Although his favourite
mistress, whom he celebrated under the fictitious name of Corinna,
is unknown, and all the conjectures concerning her identity
are groundless, there is no doubt that she was a lady of rank
and fortune.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ovid was popular as a poet, successful in society, and possessed
all the enjoyments which wealth can bestow. He had a
villa and estate in his native Sulmo, a house on the Capitoline
hill, and suburban gardens, celebrated for their beauty. At some
period of his life he travelled with Macer into Asia and Sicily;
and, in his exile, recalls to mind with sorrowful pleasure the
magnificent cities of the former, and the sublime scenery and
classic haunts of the latter.<a id='r738' /><a href='#f738' class='c012'><sup>[738]</sup></a> This sunny life at length came to
an end. The last ray of happiness, which he speaks of as beaming
on him, was the intelligence that his beloved daughter Perilla,
who was twice married, made him a grandfather a second
time. When his hair became tinged with white, and he had
reached his fiftieth year, he incurred, by some fault or indiscretion,
the anger of Augustus, and was banished to Tomi (Tomoswar
or Baba.)</p>

<p class='c011'>The cause of his banishment is involved in obscurity. It
was not unknown at Rome; but in his exile he refrains from alluding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>to it, except in dark allusions, out of fear of giving additional
offence to the emperor.<a id='r739' /><a href='#f739' class='c012'><sup>[739]</sup></a> He speaks of it as an indiscretion
(<i>error</i>,) not a crime (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">scelus</span></i>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">facinus</span></i>;<a id='r740' /><a href='#f740' class='c012'><sup>[740]</sup></a>) as something which he
had accidentally witnessed,<a id='r741' /><a href='#f741' class='c012'><sup>[741]</sup></a> perhaps had indiscreetly told—a
circumstance which deeply and personally affected Augustus, and
inflicted a wound which he was unwilling to tear open afresh.
He hints also that he fell a victim to the treachery of friends
and domestics,<a id='r742' /><a href='#f742' class='c012'><sup>[742]</sup></a> who enriched themselves by his ruin.</p>

<p class='c011'>There have been many conjectures<a id='r743' /><a href='#f743' class='c012'><sup>[743]</sup></a> on this difficult point.
Some have imagined an intrigue with the elder Julia, the profligate
daughter of Augustus; but this is scarcely consistent with
the manner in which Ovid himself speaks of his fault; and besides
this, Julia was banished to Pandataria eight years before.
The banishment of the younger Julia to Trimerus, about the
same time with that of Ovid, would make it far more probable
that his fall was connected with that of this equally profligate
princess. Tiraboschi supposed that he had surprised one
of the royal family in some disgraceful act; and some have even
imagined that he might have witnessed such conduct on the part
of the Emperor himself. Dryden believed that he accidentally
saw Livia in the bath; and the author of the article in the Biographie
Universelle, as well as Schoell,<a id='r744' /><a href='#f744' class='c012'><sup>[744]</sup></a> surmise that he was in
some way implicated in the fortunes of Agrippa Posthumus, and
thus incurred the hatred of Livia and Tiberius.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whatever the cause may have been, the punishment was a
cruel one, except for a crime of the deepest dye, and would never
have been inflicted by the gentle Augustus so long as he was
under the salutary influence of Mæcenas and his party. But in
his old age he submitted to the baneful rule of the dark Tiberius
and the implacable Livia. Any pretext, therefore, sufficed to
remove one, who, from some cause or other, had excited their enmity.
The alleged reason was the immorality of his writings;
but they are not more immoral than those of Horace; and, besides,
the worst of them had been published ten years before. Nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>was the morality of the Emperor himself of such a character as
to lead him to punish so severely a licentious poet in a licentious
age. The exclusion of his works from the Palatine<a id='r745' /><a href='#f745' class='c012'><sup>[745]</sup></a> library was
a merited and more appropriate visitation. Nevertheless, this
was made the pretext for a banishment, the misery of which
was solaced by the empty mockery of the reservation of his civil
rights.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tomi was on the very frontiers of the Roman empire, inhabited
by the Getæ, who were rude and uncivilized. The country itself,
a barren and treeless waste, cold, damp, and marshy, producing
naturally scarcely anything but wormwood, and yielding
scanty crops to the unskilled toil of ignorant cultivators, was
rendered still more desolate by frequent incursions of the neighbouring
savage tribes, who used poisoned arrows, and offered up
as sacrifices their prisoners of war.<a id='r746' /><a href='#f746' class='c012'><sup>[746]</sup></a> Ovid, who, with all his
faults, was affectionate and tender-hearted, was torn from all
the voluptuous blandishments of the capital, from the sympathies
of congenial spirits, who could appreciate his talents, and from
the arms of his weeping wife,<a id='r747' /><a href='#f747' class='c012'><sup>[747]</sup></a> amidst the voice of wailing and of
prayer, which filled every corner of his desolate dwelling. The
blow fell suddenly upon him like a thunder-clap,<a id='r748' /><a href='#f748' class='c012'><sup>[748]</sup></a> and so stupefied
him that he could make no preparations for his voyage. The
season of his departure was the depth of winter, and he was exposed
to some peril by a tempest in the Ionian Gulf. The climate
of his new abode was as inclement as that of Scythia.
Not only the Danube, but even the sea near its mouth, was for
some extent covered with ice: even the wine froze into blocks,
and was broken in pieces before it could be used. He lived in
exile only ten years; constant anxiety preyed upon his bodily
health; he suffered languor, but no pain; he loathed all food;
the little that he ate would not digest; sleep failed him; his
body became pale and emaciated, and so he died. The Tomitæ
showed their respect by erecting a tomb to his memory.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the midst of such a contrast between the present and the
past, no wonder that his complainings appear almost pitiful and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>unmanly, and his urgent petitions to Augustus couched in too
fulsome a strain of adulation. No wonder that he painted in
the most glowing colours the story of his woes and privations.
Yet he was destitute neither of patience nor fortitude: he relied
on the independence and immortality of genius; and although the
enervating effect of a luxurious and easy life and a delicate constitution,
rendered him a prey to grief, and he gradually pined
away, still he had strength of mind to relieve his sorrows by devotion
to the Muse, and he suffered with tranquillity and resignation.
Poetry was his resource during his stormy voyage. Poetry
gained him the affection and esteem of his new fellow-citizens,
notwithstanding their barbarism,<a id='r749' /><a href='#f749' class='c012'><sup>[749]</sup></a> and procured him the honour
of a tomb.</p>

<p class='c011'>All the extant poems of Ovid, with the exception of the Metamorphoses,
are elegiac. It was the metre then most in vogue.
All the minor poets, his contemporaries, wrote in it. One of
his earliest works is the “<cite class='quote'>Amores</cite>,” a collection of elegies, most
of which are addressed to his favourite mistress Corinna. Some
of them, however, were composed subsequently to his Epistles
and Art of Love.<a id='r750' /><a href='#f750' class='c012'><sup>[750]</sup></a> An epigram, which is prefixed, states that
there were originally five books, but that the author subsequently
reduced them to the present number, three. Licentiousness
disfigures these annals of his amours; but they teem with the
freshness and buoyancy of youth, and sparkle with grace and
ingenuity.</p>

<p class='c011'>The twenty-one <cite>Epistolæ Heroidum</cite>, i. e. Epistles to and from
Women of the Heroic Age, are a series of love-letters: their
characteristic feature is passion; the ardour of which is sometimes
interfered with by too laboured conceits and excessive
refinement. They are, in fact, the most polished efforts of one
whose natural indolence often disinclined him from expending
that time and pains on the work of amending and correcting
which distinguished Virgil. Their great merit consists in the
remarkable neatness with which the sentiments are expressed,
and the sweetness of the versification; their great defect is
want of variety. The subject necessarily limited the topics.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>The range of them is confined to laments for the absence of the
beloved object, the pangs of jealousy, apprehensions of inconstancy,
expressions of warm affection, and descriptions of the joys
and sorrows of love.</p>

<p class='c011'>With the exception of the Metamorphoses, the Epistles have
been greater favourites than any of the works of Ovid. Some
were translated by Drayton and Lord Hervey. The beautiful
translation, by Pope, of the epistle from Sappho to Phaon, is
familiar to all; and his touching picture of the struggle between
passion and principle, in the letter of Eloisa to Abelard, owes a
portion of its inspiration to the Epistles of Ovid.</p>

<p class='c011'>Love in the days of Ovid had nothing in it chivalrous or pure—it
was carnal, sensual. The age in which he lived was morally
polluted, and he was neither better nor worse than his contemporaries.
Great and noble as was the character of the Roman
matron, the charms of an accomplished female education were
almost as rare as at Athens. She had sterling worth; but she
had not often the power to fascinate those numbers who considered
woman the minister to the pleasures of man. She was
wise, self-sacrificing, patriotic, courageous—a devoted mother,
an affectionate wife—and a man of heroic mould valued as she
deserved such a partner of his fortunes. But those who sought
merely the allurements of passion looked only for meretricious
pleasure and sensual enjoyment. Hence grossness is the characteristic
of Ovid’s Art of Love. The instructions contained in
the first two books, which are addressed to men, are fit only for
the seducer. The blandishments in the third are suited only
to the abandoned of the other sex.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Art of Love was followed by the Remedies of Love, in one
book: “Let him,” he says, “who taught you to love, teach you
also the cure; one hand shall inflict the wound and minister the
balm. The earth produces noxious and healthful herbs; the
rose is often nearest neighbour to the nettle.”<a id='r751' /><a href='#f751' class='c012'><sup>[751]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>His Metamorphoses were just finished, and not yet corrected,<a id='r752' /><a href='#f752' class='c012'><sup>[752]</sup></a>
when his fall took place. When in his despair he burnt it, fortunately
for the world some copies transpired. Afterwards he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>prayed that they might be preserved to remind the readers of
the unhappy author. The Metamorphoses consist of fifteen
books, and contain a series of mythological narratives from the
earliest times to the translation of the soul of Julius Cæsar
from earth to heaven, and his metamorphosis into a star. This
poem is Ovid’s noblest effort: it approaches as near to the epic
form as is possible with so many naturally unconnected episodes.
In many parts, especially his descriptions, we do not
merely admire his natural facility in making verses, but picturesque
truthfulness and force—the richest fancy combined with
grandeur and dignity. Amongst the most beautiful portions
may be enumerated the story of Phaeton, including the splendid
description of the Palace of the Sun;<a id='r753' /><a href='#f753' class='c012'><sup>[753]</sup></a> the golden age;<a id='r754' /><a href='#f754' class='c012'><sup>[754]</sup></a> the story
of Pyramus and Thisbe;<a id='r755' /><a href='#f755' class='c012'><sup>[755]</sup></a> the cottage home and the rustic habits
of Baucis and Philemon,<a id='r756' /><a href='#f756' class='c012'><sup>[756]</sup></a> Narcissus at the fountain;<a id='r757' /><a href='#f757' class='c012'><sup>[757]</sup></a> the powerfully
sketched picture of the Cave of Sleep,<a id='r758' /><a href='#f758' class='c012'><sup>[758]</sup></a> Dædalus and Icarus,<a id='r759' /><a href='#f759' class='c012'><sup>[759]</sup></a>
Cephalus and Procris,<a id='r760' /><a href='#f760' class='c012'><sup>[760]</sup></a> and the soliloquy of Medea.<a id='r761' /><a href='#f761' class='c012'><sup>[761]</sup></a> In this
poem, especially, may be traced that study and learning by which
the Roman poets made all the treasures of Greek literature their
own. In fact, a more extensive knowledge of Greek mythology
may be derived from it than from the Greeks themselves, because
the books which were the sources of his information are unfortunately
no longer extant.</p>

<p class='c011'>The “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fasti</span></cite>” is an antiquarian poem on the Roman calendar.
Originally it was intended to have formed twelve books, one for

<p class='c022'>It is a beautiful specimen of simple narrative in verse, and displays
more than any of his works, his power of telling a story,
without the slightest effort, in poetry as well as prose. As a
profound study of Greek mythology and poetry had furnished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>the materials for his Metamorphoses and other poems, so in this
he drew principally from the legends which had been preserved
by the old poets and annalists of his own country.</p>

<p class='c011'>The five books of the Tristia and the four books of the Epistles
from Pontus were the outpourings of his sorrowful heart
during the gloomy evening of his days. Without the brilliancy,
the wit, and the genius, which beamed forth from his joyous
spirit in the time of his prosperity, without the graceful and
inspired querulousness of the ancient models, they are, nevertheless,
conceived in the spirit of the Greek elegy—they utter
the voice of complaining, and deserve the Horatian epithet of
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">miserabiles</span></i>.<a id='r763' /><a href='#f763' class='c012'><sup>[763]</sup></a> It was natural to him to give utterance to his
hope and despair in song: he had sported like a gay insect in
the sunshine of prosperity. He was too fragile, delicate, and effeminate
to bear the storm of adversity—his butterfly spirit was
broken; but, with all his faults, that broken heart was capable
of the tenderest emotions, and his letter to his daughter Perilla<a id='r764' /><a href='#f764' class='c012'><sup>[764]</sup></a>
is full of purity and sweetness. The carelessness of one who
would not take the trouble to correct, and who was conscious
of his dangerous facility, is compensated for by the commiseration
which his natural complaints excite, and for the powerful descriptions
which occasionally enliven the monotony inseparable
from grief.</p>

<p class='c011'>His minor poems consist of an elegiac poem, “<cite class='quote'>Nux</cite>,” in which
a nut-tree bewails its hard fate and the ill treatment which it
receives; a long and bitter satire, entitled Ibis, on some enemy,
or, perhaps, some faithless friend; a poem on Cosmetics (Medicamina
facici;<a id='r765' /><a href='#f765' class='c012'><sup>[765]</sup></a>) another on Fishing (Halieutica;<a id='r766' /><a href='#f766' class='c012'><sup>[766]</sup></a>) and an address
of condolence to Livia Augusta. None, however, of these last
three are universally admitted to be genuine. Other works
which were the offspring of his prolific genius have perished.
During his exile he acquired sufficient knowledge of the Getan
language to write some poems in it; and these were as popular
with the barbarians as his Latin works were at Rome. Lastly,
he was the author of the Medea; a tragedy of which Quintilian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>says, that it shows of what grand works he was capable, if he
had been willing to curb instead of giving reins to the luxuriance
of his genius.<a id='r767' /><a href='#f767' class='c012'><sup>[767]</sup></a> Two lines only are extant; but we can judge of
the conception which he formed of the character of Medea from
the epistle in the “<cite class='quote'>Heroides</cite>,” and her eminently tragic soliloquy
in the Metamorphoses.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ovid was a voluptuary, but not a heartless one. The age in
which he lived was as immoral as himself, and far more gross;
he was, therefore, neither a corrupter nor a seducer. His poetry
was popular, not only because of its beauty, but because it was
in exact accordance with the spirit of the times. His wit was
sometimes contrary to good taste, but it was not forced and unnatural.
He was betrayed into the appearance, not the reality
of affectation, by a luxuriance which required pruning, for which
he had neither patience nor inclination. He stored himself with
the learning of the ancients, and caught their inspiration; but
their severe taste was to him a trammel to which he was too
self-willed and self-complacent to submit. The prevalent taste
for elegiac poetry pointed out the style which was suited to his
caliber; for one cannot help feeling that his genius was incapable
of mastering the gigantic proportions of a true epic, and, notwithstanding
the favourable criticism of Quintilian, of soaring
to the sublimity of tragedy.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Gratius Faliscus.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The Cynegetica of Gratius, commonly, though without any
reason, surnamed Faliscus, may claim a place beside the Halieutica
of Ovid, on account of its subject, but not on the score of
genius, poetry, or language. Nothing is known respecting this
author, except that Ovid speaks of him as a contemporary.<a id='r768' /><a href='#f768' class='c012'><sup>[768]</sup></a> The
poem is heroic, and consists of 536 lines: its style is hard and
prosaic; it describes the weapons and arts of the chase, horses
and hounds; but the science is rather Greek than Italian, and
the information contained in it is principally derived from Xenophon.<a id='r769' /><a href='#f769' class='c012'><sup>[769]</sup></a></p>

  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Pedo Albinovanus.</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Another poet of the Ovidian age was his trusty friend, C. Pedo
Albinovanus. He was of equestrian rank,<a id='r770' /><a href='#f770' class='c012'><sup>[770]</sup></a> and, unlike most of
his contemporaries, an epic poet.<a id='r771' /><a href='#f771' class='c012'><sup>[771]</sup></a> Ovid in his Epistles from
Pontus,<a id='r772' /><a href='#f772' class='c012'><sup>[772]</sup></a> which are addressed to him, applies to him the epithet,
“<cite class='quote'>Sidereus</cite>,” either because he had written an astronomical poem,
or because his sublime language soared into the starry heavens.
Martial speaks of him as having written epigrams which extend
to the length of two pages.<a id='r773' /><a href='#f773' class='c012'><sup>[773]</sup></a> A fragment of an epic poem, describing
the voyage of Germanicus related by Tacitus, is preserved
by Seneca.<a id='r774' /><a href='#f774' class='c012'><sup>[774]</sup></a> Three elegies are usually ascribed to him;
but their style is that of more modern times, and the authority
for their genuineness very suspicious.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>A. Sabinus.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Another contemporary of Ovid was A. Sabinus; and all that
is known respecting him is derived from two passages in the
works of the former poet.<a id='r775' /><a href='#f775' class='c012'><sup>[775]</sup></a> In one of these,<a id='r776' /><a href='#f776' class='c012'><sup>[776]</sup></a> he tells us that
Sabinus wrote answers to six of the epistles of the Heroides.
None of these, however, are extant. The three which profess
to be written by him, entitled Ulysses to Penelope, Demophoon
to Phyllis, and Paris to Œnone, are the work of Angelus Sabinus,<a id='r777' /><a href='#f777' class='c012'><sup>[777]</sup></a>
a philologer and poet of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two other works are attributed to him by Ovid in a passage
in which he speaks of his death.<a id='r778' /><a href='#f778' class='c012'><sup>[778]</sup></a> One of these, entitled Trœzen,
was probably an epic poem, of which Theseus was the hero;<a id='r779' /><a href='#f779' class='c012'><sup>[779]</sup></a> the
other, <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dierum Opus</span></cite>, was a continuation of Ovid’s Fasti. Other
elegiac poets flourished at this period, such as Proculus and
Montanus; but their poetical talents were of too commonplace
a character to deserve special mention. They confer no obligation
on literature, and contribute nothing towards the illustration
of the literary character of their times.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>M. Manilius.</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The astronomical and astrological poem of Manilius furnishes
a series of those historical problems which have never yet been
satisfactorily solved. The author has been in turn confounded
with every one whom Roman records mention as bearing that
name, and in all cases with equally little reason. No one knows
when he flourished, where he lived, and of what place he was a
native. Bentley determined that he was an Asiatic; Huet that
he was a Carthaginian. Internal evidence renders it most probable
that he lived in the reign of Tiberius;<a id='r780' /><a href='#f780' class='c012'><sup>[780]</sup></a> and yet neither
he nor his poem are ever mentioned by any ancient author. His
work was never discovered until the beginning of the fifteenth
century; probably it had never been published, but only a few
copies had been made, some of which have been marvellously
preserved.</p>

<p class='c011'>The philosophical principles of the poem are those of a
Stoical Pantheism. As one principle of life pervades the whole
universe, there is a close connexion between things celestial and
things terrestrial. In consequence of this relation, the astrologer
can determine the course of the latter by observation of
the heavenly bodies. Together with all the assumptions and
absurdities of astrology are mingled extensive knowledge of
the state of astronomical science in his day: gleams of truth
shoot like meteors athwart the darkness. The subject which
he has chosen is as unpromising for poetical effect and embellishment
as that of Lucretius; but he does not handle it so successfully:
he has neither the boldness of thought, the dignity
of language, nor the imaginative grandeur which marked the
old poet philosopher. The poem is incomplete; and probably
owes some of its roughness and obscurity to its never having
been corrected for publication.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>As oratory gave to Latin prose-writing its elegance and dignity,
Cicero is not only the representative of the flourishing
period of the language, but also the instrumental cause of
its arriving at perfection. Circumstances may have been favourable
to his influence. The national mind may have been
in that stage of progress which only required a master-genius
to develop it; but still it was he who gave a fixed character to
the language, who showed his countrymen what eloquence
especially was in its combination of the precepts of art and the
principles of natural beauty; what the vigour of Latin was,
and of what elegance and polish it was capable.</p>

<p class='c011'>His age was not an age of poetry; but he paved the way for
poetry by investing the language with those graces which are
indispensable to its perfection. He freed it from all coarseness
and harshness, and accustomed the educated classes to use
language, even in their every-day conversation, which never
called up gross ideas, but was fit for pure and noble sentiments.
Before his time, Latin was plain-spoken, and therefore vigorous;
but the penalty which was paid for this was, that it was sometimes
gross and even indecent. The conversational language of
the upper classes became in the days of Cicero in the highest
degree refined: it admitted scarcely an offensive expression.
The truth of this assertion is evident from those of his writings
which are of the familiar character—from his graphic Dialogues,
in which he describes the circumstances as naturally as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>if they really occurred; from his letters to Atticus, in which he
lays open the secret thoughts of his heart to his most intimate
friend, his second self. Cicero purified the language morally
as well as æsthetically. It was the licentious wantonness of the
poets which degraded the pleasures of the imagination by pandering
to the passions at first in language delicately veiled, and
then by open and disgusting sensuality.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is difficult for us, perhaps, to whom religion comes under
the aspect of revelation separate from philosophy, and who consider
the philosophical investigation of moral subjects as different
from the religious view of morals, to form an adequate
conception of the pure and almost holy nature of the conversations
of Cicero and his distinguished contemporaries. To them
philosophy was the contemplation of the nature and attributes
of the Supreme Being. The metaphysical analysis of the internal
nature of man was the study of immortality and the evidence
for another life. Cato, for example, read the Phædo of Plato
in his last moments in the same serious spirit in which the Christian
would read the words of inspiration. The study of ethics
was that of the sanctions with which God has supported duty
and enlightened the conscience. They were the highest subjects
with which the mind of man could be conversant. For
men to meet together, as was the habitual practice of Cicero
and his friends, and pass their leisure hours in such discussions,
was the same as if Christians were to make the great truths of
the gospel the subjects of social converse.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, if we examine the character of their lighter conversations,
when they turned from philosophy to literature,—it was
not mere gossip on the popular literature of the day—it was not
even confined to works written in their native tongue—it embraced
the whole field of the literature of a foreign nation. They
talked of poets, orators, philosophers, and historians, who were
ancients to them as they are to us. They did not then think
the subject of a foreign and ancient literature dull or pedantic.
They did not consider it necessary that conversation should be
trifling or frivolous in order to be entertaining.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nor was the influence which Cicero exercised on the literature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>of his day merely extensive, but it was permanent. The great
men of whom he was the leader and guide caught his spirit.
His influence survived until external political causes destroyed
eloquence, and its place was supplied by a cold and formal rhetoric:
it was felt almost until the language was corrupted by the
admixture of barbarisms. It may be discerned in the soldier-like
plainness of Cæsar, in the Herodotean narrative of Livy,
and its sweetness without its diffuseness occasionally adorns the
reflective pages of Tacitus.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is difficult in a limited space to do justice to Cicero, even
as a literary man; such was his versatility of genius, such his
indefatigable industry, so vast the range of subjects which he
touched and adorned. Of course, therefore, it is impossible to
do more than rapidly glance at the leading events of his political
career, or at his public character, since his history is, in fact,
a history of his stirring and critical times.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>M. Tullius Cicero</span> (<span class='fss'>BORN B. C.</span> 106.)</h4>

<p class='c018'>On the banks of the noiseless and gently-flowing<a id='r781' /><a href='#f781' class='c012'><sup>[781]</sup></a> Liris (Garigliano,)
near Arpinum, the birthplace of Marius,<a id='r782' /><a href='#f782' class='c012'><sup>[782]</sup></a> lived a Roman
knight named M. Tullius Cicero. A competent hereditary estate
enabled him to devote his time to literary pursuits. He had
two sons: the elder, who bore his father’s name, was born January
3rd, <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 106. The other, Quintus, was about four years
younger. As both, and Marcus especially, displayed quick
talents and a lively disposition, and gave promise of inheriting
their father’s taste for learning, he migrated to Rome when
Marcus was about fourteen years of age. The boys were educated
with their cousins, the young Aculei.<a id='r783' /><a href='#f783' class='c012'><sup>[783]</sup></a> Q. Ælius<a id='r784' /><a href='#f784' class='c012'><sup>[784]</sup></a> taught
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>them grammar; learned Greeks instructed them in philosophy;
and the poet Archias exercised them in the technical rules of
verse, although he did not succeed in giving them the inspiration
of poetry. Quintus prided himself on his poetic skill; and a
poem by him, on the twelve zodiacal signs, is still extant.<a id='r785' /><a href='#f785' class='c012'><sup>[785]</sup></a>
Cicero also had in his boyhood some poetical taste; and there is
great elegance in the translations from the Greek which we
meet with in his works. He wrote a poem in hexameters, entitled
“<cite class='quote'>Pontius Glaucus</cite>,” as a sort of juvenile exercise, which
was extant in the time of Plutarch; and also when he was a
young man in praise of Marius.</p>

<p class='c011'>After assuming the toga virilis at sixteen years of age, M. T.
Cicero attended the forum diligently; and, by carefully exercising
himself in composition, made the eloquence of the celebrated
orators whom he heard his own, whilst from the lectures
and advice of Q. Mucius Scævola, he acquired the principles of
Roman jurisprudence.</p>

<p class='c011'>He served but little in the armies of his country: his only
campaign<a id='r786' /><a href='#f786' class='c012'><sup>[786]</sup></a> was made under the father of Pompey the Great in
the social war. During the remainder of this period, Molo, the
Rhodian rhetorician, instructed him in oratory, whilst Diodotus
the Stoic, Phædrus the Epicurean, and Philo, who had presided
over the New Academy at Athens, were his masters in philosophy.
The various schools, the principles of which he thus imbibed,
led to the eclecticism which characterizes his philosophical
creed. The bloody era of the Marian and Sullan war was passed
by him in study: he did not interfere in politics, and the fruits
of his retirement are extant in the treatise <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Inventione Rhetorica</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c011'>At twenty-five, he pleaded his first cause,<a id='r787' /><a href='#f787' class='c012'><sup>[787]</sup></a> and in the following
year defended S. Roscius of Ameria; but his constitution
was not strong enough to bear great exertion. His friends,
therefore, induced him to travel, and he determined to pass
some time at Athens.<a id='r788' /><a href='#f788' class='c012'><sup>[788]</sup></a> There was also another reason for this
recommendation. His courageous defence of Roscius had provoked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>the enmity of Chrysogonus, a creature of Sulla, and it was
therefore dangerous for him to remain at Rome. He was accompanied
by his brother Quintus,<a id='r789' /><a href='#f789' class='c012'><sup>[789]</sup></a> and found Pomponius Atticus
residing there, who afterwards became his most intimate friend.
From Athens he travelled to Asia and Rhodes, employing his
time in the cultivation of oratory, his principal study at Athens
having been philosophy. From Asia he returned to Rome<a id='r790' /><a href='#f790' class='c012'><sup>[790]</sup></a> with
improved health and an invigorated constitution; where he found
a powerful rival, as an orator, in Hortensius, who was then at
the zenith of his popularity.</p>

<p class='c011'>As soon as he was old enough,<a id='r791' /><a href='#f791' class='c012'><sup>[791]</sup></a> he was elected quæstor, and
the province of Sicily was allotted to him. In the exercise of
this office, the unusual mildness and integrity of his administration
endeared him to the provincials; whilst the judgment with
which he regulated the supplies of corn from the granary of
Rome, gained him equal credit with his fellow-countrymen. It
was during his stay in Sicily that his love of antiquarianism was
gratified by the discovery of the tomb of Archimedes.<a id='r792' /><a href='#f792' class='c012'><sup>[792]</sup></a> On his
return home<a id='r793' /><a href='#f793' class='c012'><sup>[793]</sup></a> he resumed his forensic practice: and in <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 70
was the champion of his old friends, the Sicilians, and impeached
Verres, who had been prætor of Syracuse, for oppression and
maladministration. In the following year<a id='r794' /><a href='#f794' class='c012'><sup>[794]</sup></a> he was elected curule
ædile by a triumphant majority. In the celebration of the
games which belonged to the province of this magistrate, he exhibited
great prudence by avoiding the lavish expenditure in
which so many were accustomed to indulge, whilst, at the same
time, no one could accuse him of meanness and illiberality.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the year <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 67, he obtained the prætorship, and notwithstanding
the judicial duties of his office, defended Cluentius.
Hitherto his speeches had been entirely of the judicial kind.
He now for the first time distinguished himself as a deliberative
orator, and supported the Manilian law which conferred upon
Pompey, to the discomfiture of the aristocratic party, the command
in chief of the Mithridatic war.</p>

<p class='c011'>The great object of his ambition now was the consulship, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>seemed almost inaccessible to a <i>new man</i>. As all difficulties
and prejudices were on the side of the aristocratic party, his
only hope of surmounting them was by warmly espousing the
cause of the people.</p>

<p class='c011'>Catiline and C. Antonius, who were his principal competitors,
formed a coalition, and were supported by Cæsar and Crassus,
but the influence of Pompey and the popular party prevailed;
and Cicero and Antony were elected. He entered upon his
office January 1, <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 63. At this period, perhaps, the moral
qualities of his character are the highest, and his genius shines
forth with the brightest splendour.</p>

<p class='c011'>The conspiracy of Catiline was the great event of his consulship;
a plot which its historian does not hesitate to dignify with
the title of a war. Yet this war was crushed in an unparalleled
short space of time; and a splendid triumph was gained over so
formidable an enemy, by one who wore the peaceful <i>toga</i>, not
the habiliments of a general. The prudence and tact of the
civilian did as good service as the courage and decision of the
soldier. The applause and gratitude of his fellow citizens were
unbounded, and all united in hailing him the father of his country.
One act alone laid him open to attack, and in fact eventually
caused his ruin. There is no doubt that it was unconstitutional,
although under the circumstances it was defensible, perhaps
scarcely to be avoided. This act was the execution of Lentulus,
Cethegus, and the other ringleaders, without sentence being
passed upon them by the comitia. The senate, seeing that the
danger was imminent, had invested Cicero and his colleague
with power to do all that the exigencies of the state might require
(<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">videre ne quid res publica detrimenti caperet</span></i>;) and although
it was Cicero who recommended the measure and argued in its
favour, it was the senate who pronounced the sentence, and assumed
that, as traitors, the conspirators had forfeited their rights
as citizens.</p>

<p class='c011'>The grateful people saw this clearly; and when Metellus Celer,
one of the tribunes, would have prevented Cicero from giving
an account of his administration at the close of the consular
year, he swore that he saved his country, and his oath was confirmed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>by the acclamations of the multitude. This was a great
triumph; and in sadder times he looked back to it with a justifiable
self-complacency.<a id='r795' /><a href='#f795' class='c012'><sup>[795]</sup></a> He now, as though his mission was accomplished,
refused all public dignities except that of a senator:
but he did not thus escape peril; he soon exposed himself to the
implacable vengeance of a powerful and unscrupulous enemy.
The infamous P. Clodius Pulcher intruded himself in female
attire into the rites of the Bona Dea, which were celebrated in
the house of Cæsar. Suspicion fell upon Cæsar’s wife, and a divorce
was the consequence.<a id='r796' /><a href='#f796' class='c012'><sup>[796]</sup></a> Clodius was brought to trial on
the charge of sacrilege, and pleaded an alibi. Cicero, however,
proved his presence in Rome on the very day on which the accused
asserted that he was at Interamnum.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although the guilt of Clodius was fully established, his influence
over the corrupt Roman <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">judices</span></i> was powerful enough to
procure an acquittal. Henceforward he never could forgive
Cicero, and determined to work his ruin. He caused himself to
be adopted in a plebeian family; and thus becoming qualified
for the tribunate was elected to that magistracy, <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 59. No
sooner was he appointed, than he proposed a bill for the outlawry
of any one who had caused the execution of a citizen without
trial. Cicero at once saw that this blow was aimed against
himself. He had disgusted Cæsar by his political coquetry; the
false and selfish Pompey refused to aid him in his trouble; and
spirit-broken, he fled to Brundisium,<a id='r797' /><a href='#f797' class='c012'><sup>[797]</sup></a> and thence to Thessalonica.
He had an interview with Pompey before his flight, but it led
to no results.<a id='r798' /><a href='#f798' class='c012'><sup>[798]</sup></a> He had sworn to help him as long as he felt that
there was danger, lest he should join Cæsar’s party; but when
he saw that his foes were successful, he deserted him.</p>

<p class='c011'>In his absence his exile was decreed, and his town and country
houses were given up to plunder. It cannot be denied that
during his banishment he exhibited weakness and pusillanimity:
his reverses had such an effect upon his mind that he was even
supposed to be mad.<a id='r799' /><a href='#f799' class='c012'><sup>[799]</sup></a> His great fault was vanity, of which defect
he was himself conscious, and confessed it;<a id='r800' /><a href='#f800' class='c012'><sup>[800]</sup></a> and disappointed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>vanity was the cause of his affliction. He could bear anything
better than loss of popular applause; and on this occasion, more
than any other, he gave grounds for the assertion, that “he bore
none of his calamities like a man, except his death.” Rome,
however, could not forget her preserver; and in the following
year he was recalled, and entered Rome in triumph, in the midst
of the loud plaudits of the assembled people.<a id='r801' /><a href='#f801' class='c012'><sup>[801]</sup></a> Still, however,
he was obliged to secure the prosperity which he had recovered
by political tergiversation. The measures of the triumvirate,
which he had formerly attacked with the utmost virulence, he
did not hesitate now to approve and defend.</p>

<p class='c011'>After his return<a id='r802' /><a href='#f802' class='c012'><sup>[802]</sup></a> he was appointed to a seat in the College of
Augurs; a dignity which he had anxiously coveted before his
exile, and to obtain which, he had offered almost any terms to
Cæsar and Pompey.<a id='r803' /><a href='#f803' class='c012'><sup>[803]</sup></a> The following year, much against his will,
the province of Cilicia was assigned to him. Strictly did the
accuser of Verres act up to the high and honourable principles
which he professed. His was a model administration: a stop
was put to corruption, wrongs were redressed, justice impartially
administered. Those great occasions on which he was compelled
to act on his own responsibility, and to listen to the dictates of
his beautiful soul, “<i>seine schöne seele</i>,”<a id='r804' /><a href='#f804' class='c012'><sup>[804]</sup></a> his pure, honest, and
incorruptible heart, are the bright points in Cicero’s career.
The emergency of the occasion overcame his constitutional timidity.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the year <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 49, he returned to Rome, and finding himself
in a position in which he could calmly observe the current of
affairs, and determine unbiassed what part he should take in
them, or whether it was his duty to take any part at all, his
weak, wavering, vacillating temper again got the mastery over
him. He would not do anything dishonest, but he was not chivalrous
enough to spurn at once that which was dishonourable.
Cæsar and Pompey were now at open war, and he could not make
up his mind which to join.<a id='r805' /><a href='#f805' class='c012'><sup>[805]</sup></a> He felt, probably, that the energy,
ability, and firmness of Cæsar, would be crowned with success;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>and yet his friends, his party, and his own heart were with
Pompey, and he dreaded the scorn which would be heaped upon
him if he forsook his political opinions. His were not the stern,
unyielding principles of a Cato; but the fear of what men would
say of him made him anxious and miserable. The struggle was
a long one between caution and honour, but at length honour
overcame caution. He made his decision, and went to the camp
of Pompey; but he could never rally his spirits, or feel sanguine
as to the result. He immediately saw that Pharsalia decided
the question for ever, and consequently hastened to Brundisium,
where he awaited the return of the conqueror. It was a long
time to remain in suspense; but at last the generous Cæsar
relieved him from it by a full and free pardon.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now again his character rose higher, and his good qualities
had room to display themselves. There were no longer
equally balanced parties to revive the discord which formerly
distracted his mind, nor were the circumstances of the times
such as to demand his active interference in the cause of his
country; but he was as great in the exercise of his contemplative
faculties as he had been in the brightest period of his political
life. The same faults may, perhaps, be discerned in his philosophical
speculations: the same indecision which rendered him
incapable of being a statesman or a patriot caused him to adopt
in philosophy a skeptical eclecticism. Truth was to him as variable
as political honesty; but he is always the advocate and
supporter of resignation, and fortitude, and purity, and virtue.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had hitherto suffered as a public man: he was now bowed
down by domestic affliction. A quarrel with his wife Terentia
ended in a divorce:<a id='r806' /><a href='#f806' class='c012'><sup>[806]</sup></a> such was the facility with which at Rome
the nuptial tie could be severed. His second wife was his own
ward—a young lady of large fortune; but disparity of years
and temper prevented this connexion from lasting long. In
<span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 45 he lost his daughter Tullia. The blow was overwhelming:
he sought in vain to soothe his grief in the woody solitudes of
his maritime villa at Astura, and it was long before the bereaved
father found consolation in philosophy.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>The political crisis which ensued upon the assassination of
Cæsar alarmed him for his own personal safety: he therefore
meditated a voyage to Greece; but being wind-bound at Rhegium,
the hopes of an accommodation between Antony and the
senate (a hope destined not to be realized) induced him to return.
Antony now left Rome, and Cicero delivered that torrent of
indignant and eloquent invective—his twelve Philippic orations.<a id='r807' /><a href='#f807' class='c012'><sup>[807]</sup></a>
He was again the popular idol—crowds of applauding and admiring
fellow-citizens attended him to the Forum in a kind of
triumphant procession, as they had on his return from exile.
But soon the second triumvirate was formed. Each member
readily gave up friends to satisfy the vengeance of his colleagues,
and Octavius sacrificed Cicero.</p>

<p class='c011'>The story of his death is a brief and sad one. He was enjoying
the literary retirement of his Tusculan villa when his friends
warned him of his approaching fate. He was too great a philosopher
to fear death; but too high-principled and resigned to
the Divine will to commit suicide. Still he scarcely thought
life worth preserving: “I will die,” he said, “in my fatherland,
which I have so often saved.” However, at the entreaty of his
brother, to whom he was affectionately attached, he endeavoured
to escape. He first went across the country to Astura, and there
embarked. The weather was tempestuous, and as he suffered
much from sea-sickness, he again landed at Gaëta. A treacherous
freedman betrayed him, and as he was being carried in a
litter he was overtaken by his pursuers. He would not permit
his attendants to make any resistance; but patiently and courageously
submitted to the sword of the assassins, who cut off his
head and hands and carried them to Antony. A savage joy
sparkled in the eyes of the triumvir at the sight of these bloody
trophies. His wife, Fulvia, gloated with inhuman delight upon
the pallid features, and in petty spite pierced with a needle that
once eloquent tongue. The head and hands were fixed upon the
rostrum which had so often witnessed his unequalled eloquence.
All that passed by bewailed his death, and gave vent to their
affectionate feelings.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>Although it is impossible to be blind to the numerous faults
of Cicero, few men have been more maligned and misrepresented,
and the judgment of antiquity has been, upon the whole, generally
unfavourable. He was vain, vacillating, inconstant, constitutionally
timid, and the victim of a morbid sensibility; but
he was candid, truthful, just, generous, pure-minded, and warm-hearted.
His amiability, acted upon by timidity, led him to set
too high a value on public esteem and favour; and this weakened
his moral sense and his instinctive love of virtue. That he possessed
heroism is proved by his defence of Roscius, although the
favourite of the terrible Sulla was his adversary. He was not
entirely destitute of decision, or he would not so promptly have
expressed his approbation of Cæsar’s assassins as tyrannicides.
He had resolution to strive against his over-sensitiveness, and
wisdom to see that mental occupation was its best remedy; for
in the midst of the distractions and anxieties of that eventful
and critical year which preceded the consulship of Hirtius and
Pansa an almost incredible number of works proceeded from his
pen.<a id='r808' /><a href='#f808' class='c012'><sup>[808]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>There are many circumstances to account for his political inconsistency
and indecision. He had an early predilection for
the aristocratic party; but he saw that they were narrow-minded
and behind their age. All the patricians, except Sulla and his
small party, were on the popular side. He was proud of his
connexion with Marius; and his friend Sulpicius Rufus, whom
he greatly admired, joined the Marians. For these reasons,
Cicero was inconsistent as a politician. Again, during periods
of revolutionary turbulence, moderate men are detested by both
sides; and yet it was impossible for a philosophic temper, which
could calmly and dispassionately weigh the merits and demerits
of both, to sympathize warmly with either. Cicero saw that
both were wrong: he was too temperate to approve, too honest
to pretend a zeal which he did not feel, and, therefore, he was
undecided.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, having a large benevolence, and a firm faith in virtue,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>he was unconscious of guile himself, and thought no evil of
others. He therefore mistook flattery for sincerity, and compliments
for kindness. He was vain; but vanity is a weakness not
inconsistent with great minds, and in the case of Cicero it was
fed by the unanimous voice of public approbation.</p>

<p class='c011'>As an advocate his delight was to defend, not to accuse.<a id='r809' /><a href='#f809' class='c012'><sup>[809]</sup></a> In
three only of his twenty-four orations did he undertake the office
of an accuser.</p>

<p class='c011'>Gentle, sympathizing, and affectionate, he lived as a patriot
and died as a philosopher.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Such were the life and character of Cicero. The place which
he occupies in a history of Roman literature is that of an orator
and philosopher. It has been already stated that he had some
taste for poetry: in fact, without imagination he could scarcely
have been so eminent as an orator; but though the power which
he wielded over prose was irresistible, he had not fancy enough
to give a poetical character to the language.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nor had he, notwithstanding the versatility of his talents, any
taste for historical investigation. He delighted to read the
Greek historians, for the same purpose for which he studied the
Attic orators, merely as an instrument of intellectual cultivation;
but he was ignorant of Roman history, because he took no interest
in original research. His countrymen<a id='r810' /><a href='#f810' class='c012'><sup>[810]</sup></a> expected from him
an historical work, but he was unfit for the task. It is plain
from his “<cite>Republic</cite>,” how little he knew as an antiquarian.</p>

<p class='c011'>The greatest praise of an orator’s style is to say that he was
successful. The end and object of oratory is to convince and
persuade—to rivet the attention of the hearer, and to gain a
mastery over the minds of men. If, therefore, any who study
the speeches of Cicero in the closet find faults in his style, they
must remember the very faults themselves were suited to the
object which he was carrying into execution. During the process
of raising the public taste to the highest standard, he carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>his hearers with him: he was not too much in advance; he did
not aim his shafts too high; they hit the head and heart. Senate,
judges, people understood his arguments, and felt his passionate
appeals. Compared with the dignified energy and majestic
vigour of the Athenian orator, the Asiatic exuberance of some
of his orations may be fatiguing to the sober and chastened taste
of the modern classical scholar; but in order to form a just appreciation,
he must transport himself mentally to the excitements
of the thronged Forum—to the senate composed, not of aged,
venerable men, but statesmen and warriors in the prime of life,
maddened with the party spirit of revolutionary times—to the
presence of the jury of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">judices</span></i>, as numerous as a deliberative
assembly, whose office was not merely calmly to give their verdict
of guilty or not guilty, but who were invested as representatives
of the sovereign people with the prerogative of pardoning
or condemning.</p>

<p class='c011'>Viewed in this light, his most florid passages will appear free
from affectation—the natural flow of a speaker carried away
with the torrent of his enthusiasm. The melodious rise and fall
of his periods are not the result of studied effect, but of a true
and musical ear. Undoubtedly, amongst his earlier orations, are
to be found passages somewhat too declamatory and inconsistent
with the principles which he afterwards laid down when his
taste was more matured, and when he undertook to write scientifically
on the theory of eloquence. Nor must it be concealed
that some of the staid and stern Romans of his own days were
daring enough, notwithstanding his popularity and success, to
find the same fault with him. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Suorum temporum homines</span>,”
says Quintilian, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">incessere audebant eum ut tumidiorem et Asianum<a id='r811' /><a href='#f811' class='c012'><sup>[811]</sup></a>
et redundantem<a id='t334'></a> et in repetitionibus nimium et in salibus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>aliquando frigidum et in compositione fractum et exsultantem et
pene viro molliorem</span>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But it is not only the brilliance and variety of expression, and
the finely-modulated periods, which constituted the principal
charm of Ciceronian oratory, and rendered it so effective. Its
effectiveness was mainly owing to the great orator’s knowledge
of the human heart, and of the national peculiarities of his countrymen.
Its charm was owing to his extensive acquaintance
with the stores of literature and philosophy, which his sprightly
wit moulded at will, to the varied learning which his unpedantic
mind made so pleasant and popular, to his fund of illustration at
once interesting and convincing. Even if his knowledge, because
it spread over so wide a surface, was superficial, in this case
profoundness was unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a work like the present it is only possible to devote a few
brief observations to the most important of his numerous orations,
in which, according to the criticism of Quintilian, he combined
the force of Demosthenes, the copiousness of Plato, and the elegance
of Isocrates. Knowledge of law, far superior to that possessed
by the great orators of the day,<a id='r812' /><a href='#f812' class='c012'><sup>[812]</sup></a> distinguishes his earliest
extant oration, the defence of P. Quinctius.<a id='r813' /><a href='#f813' class='c012'><sup>[813]</sup></a> Hortensius was
the defendant’s counsel. Nævius, the defendant, who had unjustly
possessed himself of the property of the plaintiff’s deceased
brother, was a deserter from the Marians, and therefore a protégé
of Sylla; but, notwithstanding these disadvantages, Cicero
gained his cause. In the masterly defence of S. Roscius,<a id='r814' /><a href='#f814' class='c012'><sup>[814]</sup></a> Cicero
again defied Sulla. His client was accused of parricide: there
was not a shadow of proof, and Cicero saved the life of an innocent
man. The noble enthusiasm with which he inveighs against
tyranny in this oration strikingly contrasts with the language, full
of sweetness, in which he describes Roman rural life. The passage
on parricide was too glowing and Asiatic for the taste of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>maturer years, and he did not hesitate to make it the subject of
severe criticism.<a id='r815' /><a href='#f815' class='c012'><sup>[815]</sup></a> Passing over speeches of less interest, we
come to the six celebrated Verrian orations. Of these <i>chefs-d’œuvre</i>
the first only was delivered.<a id='r816' /><a href='#f816' class='c012'><sup>[816]</sup></a> The others were merely
published; for the voluntary exile of the criminal rendered further
pleading unnecessary. The first is entitled “<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Divinatio</span></cite>,” <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>,
an inquiry as to who should have the right of prosecuting: Cæcilius,
who had been quæstor to the accused, claimed this privilege,
wishing to make the suit a friendly one, and thus quash the proceedings.
Nothing can surpass the ironical and sarcastic exposure
of this fraudulent attempt to defeat the ends of justice. The
noble passages in the succeeding orations of the series are well
known; the sketch of the wicked proconsul’s antecedent career;
the graceful eulogy of that province, in the welfare of which
Cicero himself felt so warm an interest; the tasteful description
of the statues and antiquities which tempted the more than Roman
cupidity of Verres; the interesting history of ancient art
which accompanies it; the burst of pathetic indignation with which
he paints the horrible tortures to which not only the provincials,
but even Roman citizens, were exposed. Transports of joy pervaded
the whole of Sicily at Cicero’s success; and the Sicilians
caused a medal to be struck with this inscription—“<span class='sc'>Prostrato
Verre Trinacria</span>.” The oration for Fonteius<a id='r817' /><a href='#f817' class='c012'><sup>[817]</sup></a> is a skilful defence
of an unpopular governor; that in defence of Cluentius<a id='r818' /><a href='#f818' class='c012'><sup>[818]</sup></a>
is one of the most remarkable <i>causes célèbres</i> of antiquity; and
the complicated scene of villany which Cicero’s forcible and soul-harrowing
language paints, makes one shudder with horror, whilst
we are struck with admiration at the clearness of intellect with
which he unravels the web of guilt woven by Oppianicus and
Sassia. This remarkable oration has been analyzed by Dr.
Blair.<a id='r819' /><a href='#f819' class='c012'><sup>[819]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Again, passing over other forensic orations, we come to that
on which he had evidently expended all his resources of art,
taste, and skill—the speech for the poet Archias.<a id='r820' /><a href='#f820' class='c012'><sup>[820]</sup></a> If possible
it is even too elaborate and polished for so graceful a theme.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>Although the object of the advocate was simply to establish the
right of his client to Roman citizenship, the genius of the poet
of Antioch furnished an opportunity not to be neglected for digressing
into the fields of literature, and for pronouncing a
truly academical eulogium on poetry. It is satisfactory to the
admirers of Cicero to find that the attack which has been made
on the genuineness of this pleasing oration is groundless and
unwarrantable.<a id='r821' /><a href='#f821' class='c012'><sup>[821]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The oration <i>pro Cælio</i><a id='r822' /><a href='#f822' class='c012'><sup>[822]</sup></a> is the most entertaining in the whole
collection. It contains a rich fund of anecdote, seasoned with
witty observations; a knowledge of human nature illustrated in
a piquant and humorous style, expressed in a tone of most gentlemanlike
yet playful eloquence, and interspersed with passages
of great beauty. It presents a marked contrast to the coarse
personal abuse which defaces the otherwise powerful invective
against L. Piso, which was delivered in the following year.<a id='r823' /><a href='#f823' class='c012'><sup>[823]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The list, though many more marvellous specimens are omitted,
must be closed with the oration in defence of T. Annius Milo.
On this occasion Cicero lost his wonted self-possession. When
the court opened, Pompey was presiding on the bench, and he
had caused the Forum to be occupied with soldiers. The sight,
added, perhaps, to the consciousness that he was advocating a
bad cause, struck Cicero with alarm; his voice trembled, his
tongue refused to give utterance to the conceptions which he
had formed. The judges were unmoved; and Milo remained
in his self-imposed exile at Marseilles. When Cicero left the
court his courage and calmness returned. He penned the
oration which is now extant. He had little or no proof or evidence
to offer, and therefore, as an argumentative work, it is
unconvincing; but for force, pathos, and the externals of eloquence,
it deserves to be reckoned amongst his most wonderful
efforts. When the exiled Milo read it, he is said to have exclaimed,
“O, Cicero, if you had pleaded so, I should not be
eating such capital fish here!” The author himself and his contemporaries
thought this his finest oration; probably its deficiencies
were concealed by its eloquence and ingenuity. It appears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>that the oration which he actually delivered was taken down in
writing by reporters, and was extant in the time of Asconius
Pedianus, the most ancient commentator on Cicero’s orations.<a id='r824' /><a href='#f824' class='c012'><sup>[824]</sup></a>
Its feebleness proved the correctness of the judgment of antiquity.</p>

<p class='c011'>The oratory of Cicero was essentially judicial: he was himself
conscious that his talents lay in that direction, and he saw
that in that field was the best opportunity for displaying oratorical
power. Even his political orations are rather judicial than
deliberative. He was not born for a politician. He possessed
not that analytical character of mind which penetrates into the
remote causes of human action, nor the synthetical power which
enables a man to follow them out to their farthest consequences;
he had not that comprehensive grasp of mind which can dismiss
at once all points of minor importance and useless speculation,
and, seizing all the salient points, can bring them to bear together
upon questions of practical expediency. Of the three
qualities necessary for a statesman he possessed only two, honesty
and patriotism: he had not political wisdom.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hence, in the finest specimens of his political harangues, his
Catilinarians and Philippics, and that in support of the Manilian
law, we look in vain for the calm, practical weighing of the subject
which is necessary in addressing a deliberative assembly.
This was not the habit of his mind. He was only lashed to
action by circumstances of great emergency; but even then he
is still an advocate—all is excitement, personal feeling, and
party spirit: he deals in invective and panegyric, and the denunciation
of the enemies of his country; and the parts which especially
call forth our admiration differ in nothing from those which
we admire in his judicial orations. Nevertheless, so irresistible
was the influence which he exercised upon the minds of his
hearers, that all his political speeches were triumphs. His
panegyric on Pompey,<a id='r825' /><a href='#f825' class='c012'><sup>[825]</sup></a> in the speech for the Manilian law, carried
his appointment as commander-in-chief of the armies of
the East. The consequence of the oration <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Provinciis Consularibus</span></cite>
continued to Cæsar his administration of Gaul. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>crushed in Catiline one of the most formidable traitors that had
ever menaced the safety of the republic. Antony’s fall followed
the complete exposure of his debauchery in private life, and
the factiousness of his public career.<a id='r826' /><a href='#f826' class='c012'><sup>[826]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Of the Catilinarians, the first and fourth were delivered in
the senate, the second and third in the presence of the people.
Every one knows the burst of indignation which the consul,
rising in his place, aims at the audacious conspirator who dared
to pollute with his presence the temple of the deity, and the
most august assembly of the Roman people. In less than
twenty-four hours Catiline had left Rome, and the conspiracy
had become a war. In four words Cicero announced this to
the assembled Romans the day after he had addressed the senate.
The third is a piece of self-complacent but pardonable egotism.
Success has overwhelmed him—he sees that all eyes are turned
upon himself—he is the hero of his own story; still he demands
no reward but the approbation of his fellow-citizens, and reminds
them that to the gods alone their gratitude is due.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two days pass away, and after Cæsar and Cicero had spoken,
Cicero again addresses the senate, and recommends that measure
which was the beginning of his troubles, the condemnation of
the conspirators. The zeal of the senate made the act their
own, but Cicero paid the penalty. The position which Cicero
occupies on this occasion invests his speech with more dignity
than is displayed in any of the preceding. He is the chief
magistrate of the republic, performing the duty of pronouncing
a capital sentence on the guilty. The excitement of the crisis
is subsiding; and he has the more composure, because he knows
that he carries with him the sympathies of the senate and
people.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Philippics, so named after the orations of Demosthenes,
are fourteen in number. Cicero commenced his attack<a id='r827' /><a href='#f827' class='c012'><sup>[827]</sup></a> upon
the object of his implacable hatred with a defence of the laws
of Cæsar, which Antony wished to repeal. He followed it up
with the celebrated second oration, in which he demolished the
character of Antony; a speech which Juvenal pronounced to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef-d’œuvre</span></i>, but which Niebuhr thought was undeserving
of being so highly exalted. He delivered the remaining twelve
in the course of the succeeding year; they were the last monuments
of his eloquence; he never spoke again. The fourteenth
is a brilliant panegyric, but nothing more; the gallant army of
Octavius received their deserved applause; but in this political
crisis the orator could not discern or even catch a glimpse of
the future destinies of his country.</p>

<p class='c011'>In his rhetorical works, Cicero left a legacy of practical instruction
to posterity. The treatise “<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Inventione</span></cite>,” although
it displays genius, is merely interesting as the juvenile production
of a future great man; and the author himself alludes
to it as a rude and unfinished production.<a id='r828' /><a href='#f828' class='c012'><sup>[828]</sup></a> Of the Rhetorical
Hand-Book, in four sections, addressed to Herennius,
it is unnecessary to speak, as it is now universally pronounced
spurious.<a id='r829' /><a href='#f829' class='c012'><sup>[829]</sup></a> The <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Oratore</span></cite>, <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Brutus sive de claris Oratoribus</span></cite>,
and <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Orator ad M. Brutum</span></cite>,<a id='r830' /><a href='#f830' class='c012'><sup>[830]</sup></a> are the result of his matured experience.
They form together one series; the principles are first
laid down; their developments are carried out and illustrated;
and lastly, in the <cite>Orator</cite>, he places before the eyes of Brutus
the model of ideal perfection. In his treatment of this subject,
he shows a mind imbued with the spirit of Plato: he invests
it with dramatic interest, and transports the reader into the
scene which he so graphically describes. The conversation contained
in the first of these works has been already described.
The scene of the second is laid on the lawn of Cicero’s palace
at Rome: Cicero, Atticus and M. Brutus are the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</span></i>;
and their taste receives inspiration from a statue of Plato
which adorns the garden. In the third, Cicero himself, at the

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Philosophy of Cicero.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Cicero somewhat arrogantly claims the credit of being the
first to awaken a taste for philosophy, and to illuminate the
darkness in which it lay hid by the light of Roman letters.<a id='r834' /><a href='#f834' class='c012'><sup>[834]</sup></a>
He did not confess the obligations under which he lay to his
predecessors, because he never could forget that he was an orator.<a id='r835' /><a href='#f835' class='c012'><sup>[835]</sup></a>
He could not deny that some of them thought justly; but
he denied that they possessed the power of expressing what they
thought. He felt that there was nothing in the philosophical
writings already existing to tempt his countrymen to study the
subject: they were dry, unadorned, unpolished. It required an
orator to array philosophy in an enticing garb. He proposed,
therefore, to assuage his anxieties—to seek repose from the
harassing cares of politics<a id='r836' /><a href='#f836' class='c012'><sup>[836]</sup></a>—by rendering his countrymen independent
of Greek philosophical literature.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was all he proposed to himself: it was all that his predecessor
had attempted; nor did he pretend to originality. The
periods which he devoted to the task, and to which all philosophical
works belong, were those during which he was excluded
from political life. The first of these was the triumvirate of
Cæsar, Pompey, and Crassus; the second was coincident with
the dictatorship of Cæsar and the consulship of Antony. Not
only did his contemplative spirit delight in such studies, but,
whilst all the avenues to distinction were closed against him,
his ambition sought this road to fame, and his patriotism urged
him to take this method of benefiting his country. But as he
was not the first who introduced philosophy to the Romans, it
will be necessary briefly to sketch its progress up to the time at
which his labours commenced.</p>

<p class='c011'>Roman philosophy was neither the result of original investigation
nor the gradual development of the Greek system. It
arose rather from a study of ancient philosophical literature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>than from an examination of philosophical principles. The
Roman intellect did not possess the power of abstraction in a
sufficiently high degree for research, nor was the Latin language
capable of representing satisfactorily abstract thoughts. Cicero
was quite aware of the poverty of its scientific nomenclature, as
compared with that of Greece. In one treatise,<a id='r837' /><a href='#f837' class='c012'><sup>[837]</sup></a> he writes,—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Equidem
soleo etiam, quod uno Græci, si aliter non possum,
idem pluribus verbis exprimere</span>.” Pliny<a id='r838' /><a href='#f838' class='c012'><sup>[838]</sup></a> and Seneca<a id='r839' /><a href='#f839' class='c012'><sup>[839]</sup></a> assert the
same fact. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magis damnabis</span>,” writes the latter, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">angustias
Romanas si scieris unam syllabam esse, quam mutare non possim.
Quæ hæc sit quæris?</span> <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">το ον.</span>” The practical character also of the
people prompted them to take advantage of the material already
furnished by others, and to select such doctrines as it approved,
without regard to their relation to each other.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Roman philosopher, therefore, or rather (to speak more
correctly) philosophical student, did not throw himself into the
speculations of his age, pursue them contemporaneously, or deduce
from them fresh results. He went back to the earlier ages
of Greek philosophy, studied, commented on, and explained the
works of the best authors, and adopted some of their doctrines
as fixed scholastic dogmas. Consequently, the spirit in which
philosophical study was pursued by the Romans was a literary
and not a scientific one. A taste for literature had been awakened,
and philosophy was considered only as one species of
literature, although its importance was recognised as bearing
upon the practical duties, the highest interests and happiness of
man. The practical view which Cicero took of philosophy, and
the extensive influence which he attributed to it, is manifest
from numerous passages in his works,<a id='r840' /><a href='#f840' class='c012'><sup>[840]</sup></a> and is imbodied in the
following beautiful apostrophe in the Tusculan Disputations:<a id='r841' /><a href='#f841' class='c012'><sup>[841]</sup></a>
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">O vitæ Philosophia dux! O virtutis indagatrix, expultrixque
vitiorum! Quid non modo nos, sed omnino vita hominum sine te
esse potuisset? Tu urbes peperisti; tu dissipatos homines in societatem
vitæ convocasti; tu eos inter se primo domiciliis, deinde
conjugiis, tum literarum et vocum communione junxisti; tu inventrix
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>legum, tu magistra morum et disciplinæ fuisti; ad te
confugimus, a te opem petimus; tibi nos, ut antea magna ex
parte, sic nunc penitus totosque tradimus.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011'>It is plain, therefore, that the chief characteristics of Roman
philosophy would be—(1.) Learning, for it consisted in bringing
together doctrines and opinions scattered over a wide field; (2,)
Generally speaking, an ethical purpose and object, for Romans
would be little inclined to value any subject of study which had
no ultimate reference to man’s political and social relations; (3,)
Eclecticism; for although there were certain schools, such as the
Epicurean and Stoic, which were evidently favourites, the dogmas
of different teachers were collected and combined together
often without regard to consistency.</p>

<p class='c011'>The defects of such a system are fatal to its claim to be considered
philosophical; for the scientific connexion of its parts is
lost sight of, and results are presented independent of the chain
of causes and effects by which they are connected with principles.
Such a system must necessarily be illogical and inconsequential.
Even the liberality which adopts the principle, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nullius jurare
in verba magistri</span>,” and which, therefore, appears to be its chief
merit, was absurd; and the willingness with which all views
were readily admitted led to skepticism, or doubt whether such
a thing as absolute truth had a real existence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Greek philosophy was probably first introduced into Rome
by the Achæan exiles, of whom Polybius was one.<a id='r842' /><a href='#f842' class='c012'><sup>[842]</sup></a> The embassy
of Carneades the Academic, Diogenes the Stoic, and Critolaus
the Peripatetic, followed six years afterwards. In vain the
stern M. Porcius Cato caused their dismissal; for some of the
most illustrious and accomplished Romans, such as Africanus,
Lælius, and Furius, had already profited by their lectures and
instructions.<a id='r843' /><a href='#f843' class='c012'><sup>[843]</sup></a> Whilst the educated Romans were gaining an
historical insight into the doctrines of these schools, the Stoic
Panætius, who was entertained in the household of Scipio Africanus,
was unfolding the mysterious and transcendental doctrines
of the great object of his veneration, Plato. But although the
Romans could appreciate the majestic dignity and poetical beauty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>of his style, they were not equal to the task of penetrating his
hidden meaning; they were, therefore, content to take upon trust
the glosses and commentaries of his expositors. These inclined
to the New Academy rather than to the Old: in its skeptical
spirit they compared and balanced opposing probabilities; and
went no farther than recommending the adoption of opinions
upon which they could not pronounce with certainty. Neither
did the Peripatetic doctrines meet with much favour, although
the works of Aristotle had been brought to Rome by the dictator
Sulla, partly, as Cicero says, because of the vastness of the subjects
treated, partly because they seemed incapable of satisfactory
proof to unskilled and inexperienced minds.<a id='r844' /><a href='#f844' class='c012'><sup>[844]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The philosophical system which first arrested the attention of
the Romans, and gained an influence over their minds, was the
Epicurean.<a id='r845' /><a href='#f845' class='c012'><sup>[845]</sup></a> But it is somewhat remarkable that, although this
philosophy was in its general character ethical, a people so eminently
practical in their turn of mind should have especially
devoted themselves to the study of the physical speculations of
this school.<a id='r846' /><a href='#f846' class='c012'><sup>[846]</sup></a> The only apparent exception to this statement is
Catius, but even his principal works, although he wrote one, “<i>de
Summo Bono</i>,” are on the physical nature of things.<a id='r847' /><a href='#f847' class='c012'><sup>[847]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Cicero accounts for the popularity of Epicureanism by saying
that it was easy—that it appealed to the blandishments of pleasure;
and that its first professors, Amafanius and Rabirius, used
none of the refinements of art or subtleties or dialectic, but clothed
their discussions in a homely and popular style, suited to the
simple and unlearned. There were many successors to Amafanius;
and the doctrines which they taught rapidly spread over
the whole of Italy. Many illustrious statesmen, also, were
amongst the believers in this fashionable creed; of whom the
best known are C. Cassius, the fellow-conspirator of Brutus, and
T. Pomponius Atticus, the friend of Cicero. All the monuments
and records, however, of the Epicurean philosophy, which were
published in Latin, have perished, with the exception of the
immortal work of T. Lucretius Carus, “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Naturâ Rerum</span></cite>.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>Nor was Stoicism, the severe principles of which were in harmony
with the stern old Roman virtues, without distinguished
disciples; such as were the unflinching M. Brutus, the learned
Terentius Varro, the jurist Scævola, the unbending Cato of
Utica, and the magnificent Lucullus—a Stoic in creed, though
not in life and conduct. The part which Cicero’s character
qualified him to perform in the philosophical instruction of his
countrymen was scarcely that of a guide: he could give them a
lively interest in the subject, and reveal to them the discoveries
and speculations of others, but he could not mould and form their
belief, and train them in the work of original investigation.
Not being himself devoutly attached to any system of philosophical
belief, he would be cautious of offending the philosophical
prejudices of others. He loved learning, but his temper was undecided
and vacillating: whilst, therefore, he delighted in accumulating
stores of Greek erudition, the tendency of his mind
was, in the midst of a variety of inconsistent doctrines, to leave
the conclusion undetermined. Although he listened to various
instructors—Phædrus the Epicurean, Diodotus the Stoic, and
Philo the Academician—he found the eclecticism of the latter
more congenial to his taste. Its preference of probability to
certainty suited one who shrunk from the responsibility of deciding.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is this personality, as it were, which gives a special interest
to the Ciceronian philosophy. The reflexion of his personal
character which pervades it rescues it from the imputation of
being a mere transcript of his Greek originals. Cicero brings
everything as much as possible to a practical standard. If the
question arises between the study of morals and politics and that
of physics or metaphysics, he decides in favour of the former,
on the grounds that the latter transcends the capacities of the
human intellect;<a id='r848' /><a href='#f848' class='c012'><sup>[848]</sup></a> that in morals and politics we are under obligations
from which in physics we are free; that we are bound
to tear ourselves from these abstract studies at the call of duty
to our country or our fellow-creatures, even if we were able to
count the stars or measure the magnitude of the universe.<a id='r849' /><a href='#f849' class='c012'><sup>[849]</sup></a> In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>the didactic method which he pursues he bears in mind that he
is dealing not with contemplative philosophers, or minds that
have been logically trained, but with statesmen and men of the
world; he does not therefore claim too much, or make his lessons
too hard, and is always ready to sacrifice scientific system to a
method of popular instruction. His object seems to be to recommend
the subject—to smoothe difficulties, and illustrate
obscurities. He evidently admires the exalted purity of Stoical
morality; and the principles of that sect are those which he
endeavours to impress upon his son.<a id='r850' /><a href='#f850' class='c012'><sup>[850]</sup></a> His only fear is that their
system is impracticable.<a id='r851' /><a href='#f851' class='c012'><sup>[851]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Cicero believed in the existence of one supreme Creator and
Governor of the universe, and also in His spiritual nature;<a id='r852' /><a href='#f852' class='c012'><sup>[852]</sup></a> but
his belief is rather the result of instinctive conviction, than of
the proofs derived from philosophy; for as to them, he is, as on
other points, uncertain and wavering. He disbelieved the
popular mythical religion; but, uncertain as to what was the
truth, he would not have that disturbed which he looked upon as
a political engine.<a id='r853' /><a href='#f853' class='c012'><sup>[853]</sup></a> Amidst the doubtful and conflicting reasons,
respecting the human soul and man’s eternal destiny, there is no
doubt that, although he finds no satisfactory proof, he is a believer
in immortality.<a id='r854' /><a href='#f854' class='c012'><sup>[854]</sup></a> It is unnecessary to pursue the subject of his
philosophical creed any further, because it is not a system, but
only a collection of precepts, not of investigations. Its materials
are borrowed, its illustrations alone novel. But, nevertheless,
the study of Cicero’s philosophical works is invaluable, in order
to understand the minds of those who came after him. It must
not be forgotten, that not only all Roman philosophy after his
time, but a great part of that of the middle ages, was Greek philosophy
filtered through Latin, and mainly founded on that of
Cicero. Cicero’s works on speculative philosophy generally
consist of—(1.) <cite>The Academics</cite>, or a history and defence of the
belief of the New Academy. (2.) The <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Finibus Bonorum et
Malorum</span></cite>, dialogues on the supreme good, the end of all moral
action. (3.) <cite>The Tusculanæ Disputationes</cite>, containing five independent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>treatises on the fear of death, the endurance of pain, the
power of wisdom over sorrow, the morbid passions, the relation
of virtue to happiness. In these treatises Stoicism predominates,
although opinions are adduced from the whole range of Greek
philosophy. (4.) <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Paradoxa</span></cite>, in which the six celebrated Stoical
paradoxies are touched upon in a light and amusing manner.
(5.) A dialogue in praise of philosophy, named after Hortensius.
(6.) Translations of the Timæus and Protagoras of Plato. Of
these last three treatises only a few fragments remain.</p>

<p class='c011'>His moral philosophy comprehends—(1.) The <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Officiis</span></cite>, a
Stoical treatise on moral obligations, addressed to his son Marcus,
at that time a student at Athens. (2.) The unequalled little
essays on Friendship and Old Age. A few words also are preserved
of two books on Glory, addressed to Atticus; and one
which he wrote on the Alleviation of Grief when bereaved of
his beloved daughter.<a id='r855' /><a href='#f855' class='c012'><sup>[855]</sup></a> He left one theological work in three
parts: the first part is on the “<cite class='quote'>Nature of the Gods;</cite>” the second
on the “<cite class='quote'>Science of Divination;</cite>” the third on “<cite class='quote'>Fate</cite>,” of which
an inconsiderable fragment is extant. His office of augur probably
suggested to him the composition of these treatises.</p>

<p class='c011'>His political works are two in number—the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Republica</span></cite><a id='r856' /><a href='#f856' class='c012'><sup>[856]</sup></a> and
<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Legibus</span></cite>; both are imperfect. The remains of the former
are only fragmentary; of the latter, three out of six books are
extant, and those not entire. Nevertheless, sufficient of both
remains to enable us to form some estimate of their philosophical
character. Although he does not profess originality, but confesses
that they are imitations of the two treatises of Plato, which
bear the same name, still they are more inductive than any of
his other treatises. His purpose is, like that of Plato, to give
in the one an ideal republic, and in the other a sketch of a model
legislation; but the novelty of the treatment consists in their
principles being derived from the Roman constitution and the
Roman laws.</p>

<p class='c011'>The questions which he proposes to answer are, what is the
best government and the best code: but the limits within which
he confines himself are the institutions of his country. In the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>Republic he first discusses, like the Greek philosophers, the
merits and demerits of the three pure forms of government; and
upon the whole decides in favour of monarchy<a id='r857' /><a href='#f857' class='c012'><sup>[857]</sup></a> as the best. With
Aristotle<a id='r858' /><a href='#f858' class='c012'><sup>[858]</sup></a> he agrees that all the pure forms are liable to degenerate,<a id='r859' /><a href='#f859' class='c012'><sup>[859]</sup></a>
and comes to the conclusion that the idea of a perfect polity
is a combination of all three.<a id='r860' /><a href='#f860' class='c012'><sup>[860]</sup></a> In order to prove and illustrate
his theory, he investigates, though it must be confessed in a
meager and imperfect manner, the constitutional history of Rome,
and discovers the monarchical element in the consulship, the aristocratic
in the senate, and the popular in the assembly of the
people and the tribunitial authority.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Romans continued jealously to preserve the shadow of
their constitution even after they had surrendered the substance.
Nominally, the titles and offices of the old republic never perished—the
Emperor was in name nothing more than (Imperator)
the commander-in-chief of the armies of the republic, but in him
all power centred: he was absolute, autocratic, the chief of a
military despotism.<a id='r861' /><a href='#f861' class='c012'><sup>[861]</sup></a> Cicero, as the treatise <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Legibus</span></cite> plainly
shows, saw, with approbation, that this state of things was rapidly
coming to pass; that the people were not fitted to be trusted
with liberty, and yet that they would be contented with its
semblance and name.</p>

<p class='c011'>The method which he pursues, is, firstly, to treat the subject
in the abstract, and to investigate the nature of law; and,
secondly, to propose an ideal code, limited by the principles of
Roman jurisprudence. Thus Cicero’s polity and code were not
Utopian—the models on which they were formed had a real tangible
existence. His was the system of a practical man, as the
Roman constitution was that of a practical people. It was not
like Greek liberty, the realization of one single idea; it was like
that of England, the growth of ages, the development of a long
train of circumstances, and expedients, and experiments, and
emergencies. Cicero prudently acquiesced in the ruin of liberty
as a stern necessity; but he evidently thought that Rome had attained
the zenith of its national greatness immediately before
the agitations of the Gracchi.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>Both these works are written in the engaging form of dialogues.
In the one, Scipio Æmilianus, Lælius, Scævola, and
others, meet together in the Latin holidays (Feriæ Latinæ,) and
discuss the question of government. In the other, the writer
himself, with his brother Quintus and Atticus, converse on jurisprudence
whilst they saunter on a little islet near Arpinum
at the confluence of the Liris and Fibrena.</p>

<p class='c011'>We must, lastly, contemplate Cicero as a correspondent. This
intercourse of congenial minds separated from one another, and
induced by the force of circumstances to digest and arrange their
thoughts in their communication, forms one of the most delightful
and interesting, and at the same time one of the most characteristic,
portions of Roman literature. A Roman thought that
whenever he put pen to paper it was his duty, to a certain extent,
to avoid carelessness and offences against good taste, and to bestow
upon his friend some portion of that elaborate attention which,
as an author, he would devote to the public eye. In fact the
letter-writer was almost addressing the same persons as the author;
for the latter wrote for the approbation of his friends, the
circle of intimates in which he lived: the approbation of the public
was a secondary object. The Greeks were not writers of letters:
the few which we possess were mere written messages, containing
such necessary information as the interruption of intercourse
demanded. There was no interchange of hopes and fears,
thoughts, sentiments, and feelings.</p>

<p class='c011'>The extent of Cicero’s correspondence is almost incredible:
even those epistles which remain form a very voluminous collection—more
than eight hundred are extant. The letters to his
friends and acquaintances (ad Familiares) occupy sixteen books;
those to Atticus sixteen more; and we have besides three books
of letters to Quintus, and one to Brutus; but the authenticity of
this last collection is somewhat doubtful. It is quite clear that
none of them were intended for publication, as those of Pliny
and Seneca were. They are elegant without stiffness, the natural
outpourings of a mind which could not give birth to an ungraceful
idea. When speaking of the perilous and critical politics
of the day, more or less restraint and reserve are apparent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>according to the intimacy with the person whom he is addressing,
but no attempt at pompous display. His style is so simple
that the reader forgets that Cicero ever wrote or delivered an
oration. There is the eloquence of the heart, not of the rhetoric
school. Every subject is touched upon which could interest the
statesman, the man of letters, the admirer of the fine arts, or
the man of the world. The writer reveals in them his own motives,
his secret springs of actions, his loves, his hatreds, his
strength, his weakness. They extend over more than a quarter
of a century, the most interesting period of his own life, and one
of the most critical in the history of his country. The letters
to Quintus are those of an elder brother to one who stood in
great need of good advice. Although Quintus was not deserving
of his brother’s affection, M. Cicero was warmly attached to
him, and took an interest in his welfare. Quintus was proprætor
of Asia, and not fitted for the office; and Cicero was not sparing
in his admonitions, though he offered them with kindness and
delicacy. The details of his family concerns form not the least
interesting portion of this correspondence. There is, as might
be expected, more reserve in the letters <i>ad Familiares</i> than in
those addressed to Atticus. They are written to a variety of
correspondents, of every shade and complexion of opinions, many
of them mere acquaintances, not intimate friends; but whilst, for
this reason, less historically valuable, they are the most pleasing
of the collection, on account of the exquisite elegance of their
style. They are models of pure Latinity. In the letters to
Atticus, on the other hand, he lays bare the secrets of his heart;
he trusts his life in his hands; he is not only his friend but his
confidant, his second self. Were it not for the letters of Cicero,
we should have had but a superficial knowledge of this period
of Roman history, as well as of the inner life of Roman society.</p>

<p class='c011'>An elegant poetic compliment paid to Cicero by Laurea Tullus,
one of his freedmen, has been preserved by Pliny.<a id='r862' /><a href='#f862' class='c012'><sup>[862]</sup></a> The subject

<p class='c011'>The correspondents of Cicero included a number of eminent
men. Atticus was the least interesting, for his politic caution
rendered him unstable and insincere; but there was Cassius the
tyrannicide; the Stoical Cato of Utica; Cæcina, the warm partisan
of Pompey; the orator Cælius Rufus; Hirtius and Oppius, the literary
friends of Cæsar; Lucceius the historian; Matius the mimiambic
poet; and that patron of arts and letters,<a id='r863' /><a href='#f863' class='c012'><sup>[863]</sup></a> C. Asinius Pollio.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pollio was a scion of a distinguished house, and was born at
Rome <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 76.<a id='r864' /><a href='#f864' class='c012'><sup>[864]</sup></a> Even as a youth he was distinguished for wit and
sprightliness;<a id='r865' /><a href='#f865' class='c012'><sup>[865]</sup></a> and at the age of twenty-two was the prosecutor
of C. Cato. He was with Cæsar at the Rubicon, at Pharsalia,
in Africa, and in Spain; and was finally intrusted with the conduct
of the war in that province against Sextus Pompey. On
the establishment of the first triumvirate, Pollio, after some hesitation,
sent in his adhesion; and Antony intrusted him with the
administration of Gallia Transpadana, including the allotment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>of the confiscated lands among the veteran soldiers. He thus
had opportunity of protecting Virgil and saving his property.
In <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 40, Octavian and Antony were reconciled at Brundisium
by his mediation. A successful campaign in Illyria concluded
his military career with the glories of a triumph,<a id='r866' /><a href='#f866' class='c012'><sup>[866]</sup></a> and he then
retired from public life to his villa at Tusculum, and devoted
himself to study. He enjoyed life to the last, and died in his
eightieth year. He left three children, one of whom, Asinius
Gallus,<a id='r867' /><a href='#f867' class='c012'><sup>[867]</sup></a> wrote a comparison between his father and Cicero,
which was answered by the Emperor Claudius.<a id='r868' /><a href='#f868' class='c012'><sup>[868]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>In oratory, poetry, and history, Pollio enjoyed a high reputation
among contemporary critics, and yet none of his works
have survived. The solution of this difficulty may, perhaps, be
found in the following circumstances:—1. His patronage of
literary men rendered him popular, and drew from the critics a
somewhat partial verdict. His kindness caused Horace to extol<a id='r869' /><a href='#f869' class='c012'><sup>[869]</sup></a>
him, and Virgil to address to him his most remarkable eclogue.<a id='r870' /><a href='#f870' class='c012'><sup>[870]</sup></a>
2. His taste was formed before the new literary school commenced.
He had always a profound admiration for the old
writers, and frequently quoted them. His style probably appeared
antiquated and pedantic, and, therefore, never became
generally popular. A later writer<a id='r871' /><a href='#f871' class='c012'><sup>[871]</sup></a> says, that he was so harsh
and dry as to appear to have reproduced the style of Attius and
Pacuvius, not only in his tragedies, but also in his orations.
Quintilian observes,<a id='r872' /><a href='#f872' class='c012'><sup>[872]</sup></a> that he seemed to belong to the pre-Ciceronian
period. Niebuhr, who could only form his opinion upon
the slight fragments preserved by Seneca, for the three letters
in Cicero’s collection<a id='r873' /><a href='#f873' class='c012'><sup>[873]</sup></a> are only despatches, affirms that he seems
to stand between two distinct generations,<a id='r874' /><a href='#f874' class='c012'><sup>[874]</sup></a> namely, the literary
periods of Cicero and Virgil. His great work was a history of
the civil wars, in seventeen books. He pretended to be a critic,
but his criticism was fastidious and somewhat ill-natured. He
found blemishes in Cicero, inaccuracies in Cæsar, pedantry in
Sallust, and provincialism (Patavinitas) in Livy. The correctness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>of his judgment respecting the charming narratives of the
great historian has been assumed from generation to generation,
yet no one can discover in what this <i>Pativinity</i> consists.
It was easier to find fault than to write correctly; for, whilst all
the labours of the critic have perished, Cicero, Cæsar, Sallust,
and Livy are immortal. Vehemence and passion developed his
character.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still he was one of the greatest benefactors to the literature
of his country; more especially as he was the first to found a
public library. Books had already been brought to Rome, and
collections formed. Æmilius Paulus had a library—Lucullus
had one also, to which he allowed learned men to have access.
Sulla enriched Rome with the plunder of the Athenian libraries;
and in his time Tyrannis the grammarian was the possessor
of three thousand volumes. Julius Cæsar employed the learned
Varro to collect books with a view to a national collection, but
death put a stop to his intentions.<a id='r875' /><a href='#f875' class='c012'><sup>[875]</sup></a> Pollio expended the spoils
of Dalmatia in founding a temple to Liberty in the Aventine,
and furnishing it with a library, the nucleus of which were the
collections of Sulla and Varro. After this time, the work was
carried on by imperial munificence. Augustus founded the Octavian
library in the temple of Juno, and the Palatine in the
palace. Tiberius augmented the latter. Vespasian placed one
in the temple of Peace. Trajan formed the Ulpian; Domitian
the Capitoline; Hadrian a magnificent one at his own villa; and
in the reign of Constantine the number of public libraries exceeded
twenty.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>M. Terentius Varro Reatinus</span> (<span class='fss'>BORN B. C.</span> 116.)</h4>

<p class='c018'>On an ancient medal is represented the effigy of Julius Cæsar
bearing a book in one hand and a sword in the other,<a id='r876' /><a href='#f876' class='c012'><sup>[876]</sup></a> with the
legend “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex utroque Cæsar</span>.” This device represents the genius
of many a distinguished citizen of the republic, and that of
Varro amongst the number, for he was a soldier, and at the
same time the most learned of his countrymen. He was born<a id='r877' /><a href='#f877' class='c012'><sup>[877]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>at Reate (Rieti,) a Sabine town situated in the Tempe of Italy,
in the neighbourhood of the celebrated cascade of Terni.
Ælius Stilo, the antiquarian, was the instructor of his earlier
years,<a id='r878' /><a href='#f878' class='c012'><sup>[878]</sup></a> and from him he derived his thirst for knowledge, and
his ardent devotion to original investigation. He subsequently
studied philosophy under Antiochus, a professor of the Academic
school.<a id='r879' /><a href='#f879' class='c012'><sup>[879]</sup></a> In politics he was warmly attached to the party of
Pompey, under whom he served in the Piratic and Mithridatic
wars. He was also one of his three <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Legati</span></i> in Spain, and did
not resign his command until the towns in the south of that
province eagerly submitted to Cæsar. After the battle of Pharsalia,
he experienced the clemency of the conqueror, but not soon
enough to save his villa from being attacked and plundered.<a id='r880' /><a href='#f880' class='c012'><sup>[880]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Cæsar appreciated Varro’s extensive learning and intrusted
to him the formation of the great public library.<a id='r881' /><a href='#f881' class='c012'><sup>[881]</sup></a> Henceforth
he shunned the perils of political life,<a id='r882' /><a href='#f882' class='c012'><sup>[882]</sup></a> and in the retirement of
his villas devoted himself zealously to the pursuit of literature.
Nevertheless he could not escape the unrelenting persecution of
political party; for in that proscription to which Cicero fell a
victim, his name was in the list until it was erased by Antony.<a id='r883' /><a href='#f883' class='c012'><sup>[883]</sup></a>
Although he was seventy years old, his industry was unabated,
and he continued his literary labours until his death, which
took place in the eighty-ninth year of his age.<a id='r884' /><a href='#f884' class='c012'><sup>[884]</sup></a> Varro was a
man of ponderous erudition and unwearied industry,<a id='r885' /><a href='#f885' class='c012'><sup>[885]</sup></a> without
a spark of taste and genius. No Roman author wrote so much
as he did, no one read so much except Pliny; yet, notwithstanding
all this practice and study, he never acquired an agreeable
style. He dissected and anatomized the Latin language with
all the powers of critical analysis; but he was never imbued
with its elegant polish or its nervous eloquence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wherever, as in the case of his treatise on agriculture, he
had access to sound information and good authority, his habits
of arrangement, the clearness with which he classified, and the
careful judgment with which he adduced his facts, render his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>works valuable. Few men have possessed greater powers of
combining and systematizing: his mind was, as it were, full of
compartments, in which each species of knowledge had its
proper place, but it was nothing more. Whenever he left the
beaten track of other men’s discoveries, and indulged in free
conjecture or original thought, as in his grammatical works, his
learning seems to desert him; and etymology, which has tempted
so many mere conjecturers to go astray, led him also into absurdity.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of his works, <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antiquitates Divinarum Rerum</span></cite>, acquires
a peculiar interest from the fact of its having been the storehouse
from which St. Augustine, who was a great admirer of
his learning, derived much of his treatise <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Civitate Dei</span></cite>. How
this laborious compilation was lost it is impossible to say. We
can only lament the accident which deprives us of the work to
which especially the author owes his reputation. In the treatise,
which together with this forms one work, namely, <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Antiquitates
Rerum Humanarum</span></cite>, he investigated the early history and
chronology of Rome,<a id='r886' /><a href='#f886' class='c012'><sup>[886]</sup></a> and fixed the date of the building of the
city in the year <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 753, a date which is now commonly received
by the best historians.<a id='r887' /><a href='#f887' class='c012'><sup>[887]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>A catalogue of his numerous books and tracts on almost every
subject which then engaged the attention of literary men—on
history, biography, geography, philosophy, criticism, and morals—would
be uninteresting, but his principal works were as follows:—</p>

</div>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Historical Writers.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>In historical composition alone can the Romans lay claim to
originality; and in their historical literature especially is exhibited
a faithful transcript of their mind and character. History
at once gratified their patriotism, and its investigations were
in accordance with their love of the real and practical. Thus
those natural powers which had been elicited and cultivated by
an acquaintance with Greek literature were applied with a naïve
simplicity to the narration of events, and embellished them with
all the graces of a refined style. The practical good sense and
political wisdom which the Roman social system was admirably
adapted to nurture found food for reflection: their shrewd insight
into character, and their searching scrutiny into the human
heart gave them a power over their materials; and hence they
were enabled in this department of literature to emulate, not
merely imitate, the Greeks, and to be their rivals, and sometimes
their superiors. The elegant simplicity of Cæsar is as
attractive as that of Herodotus; not one of the Greek historians
surpasses Livy in talent for the picturesque, and in the charm
with which he invests his spirited and living stories; whilst for
condensation of thought, terseness of expression, and political
and philosophical acumen, Tacitus is not inferior to Thucydides.</p>

<p class='c011'>The subjects which historical investigation furnished were so
peculiarly national, so congenial to the character of the mind
of the Romans, that they seem to have cast aside their Greek
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>originals, and to have struck out an independent line for themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>The catalogue of Roman historians is a proud one. At the
head of it stand the four great names of Cæsar, Sallust, Livy,
and Tacitus; all of whom, except the last, belong to the Augustan
age. It comprehends those of Cornelius Nepos, Trogus
Pompeius, Cremutius Cordus, Aufidius Bassus, and Sallust, in the
golden age; Velleius Paterculus, Valerius Maximus, Q. Curtius,
Suetonius, and Florus, in the succeeding one; nor must L. Lucceius
and L. Licinius Lucullus be passed over without mention.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>L. Lucceius.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>L. Lucceius, the friend and correspondent of Cicero,<a id='r888' /><a href='#f888' class='c012'><sup>[888]</sup></a> was an
orator who espoused the party of J. Cæsar, and relying on his influence,
became, together with him, a candidate for the consulship.<a id='r889' /><a href='#f889' class='c012'><sup>[889]</sup></a>
Being unsuccessful, he quitted politics for the calm enjoyment
of a literary life. His right to be called an historian is founded
on his having commenced a history of the Social and Civil Wars,
but it was never completed or published. Cicero<a id='r890' /><a href='#f890' class='c012'><sup>[890]</sup></a> entreats him
to speak of the events which he was recording, as well as of his
own character and conduct, with partiality; it is, therefore, impossible
to trust the encomiums which accompany this request, as
they were probably dictated by a wish to purchase his favourable
opinion. The period of his retirement from public affairs
was not of long duration, for he afterwards again engaged in
the civil strife which agitated Rome, and joined the party of
Pompey, who held him in high estimation.<a id='r891' /><a href='#f891' class='c012'><sup>[891]</sup></a> On his downfall he
shared with other Pompeians the clemency of the dictator.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>L. Licinius Lucullus.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>L. Licinius Lucullus,<a id='r892' /><a href='#f892' class='c012'><sup>[892]</sup></a> the illustrious but luxurious conqueror
of Mithridates, did not disdain to devote his leisure to the composition
of history, although his works are not of such merit as
to claim for him a distinguished position among the historians of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>his country. The stirring events of the Social War tempted
him to record them.<a id='r893' /><a href='#f893' class='c012'><sup>[893]</sup></a> Part of his enormous wealth he had expended
on a magnificent library: to the poet Archias he was a
kind friend;<a id='r894' /><a href='#f894' class='c012'><sup>[894]</sup></a> and his patronage was liberally granted to literary
men, especially to those philosophers who held the doctrines of
his favourite Academy. Like most of those who combined with
a love of literature a life of activity in the public service of his
country, he was an orator of no mean abilities.<a id='r895' /><a href='#f895' class='c012'><sup>[895]</sup></a> His love of
Greek, and his habits of intercourse with Greek philosophers, led
him to write his history in the Greek language, and to select
and transcribe extracts from the histories of Cælius Antipater
and Polybius.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Cornelius Nepos.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Cornelius Nepos was a contemporary of Catullus, and lived
until the sixth year of the reign of Augustus.<a id='r896' /><a href='#f896' class='c012'><sup>[896]</sup></a> Ausonius says
that he was a Gaul,<a id='r897' /><a href='#f897' class='c012'><sup>[897]</sup></a> Catullus that he was an Italian.<a id='r898' /><a href='#f898' class='c012'><sup>[898]</sup></a> Both are
probably right, as the prevailing opinion is, that he was born
either at Verona, or the neighbouring village of Hostilia in
Cisalpine Gaul. Besides Catullus, he reckoned Cicero<a id='r899' /><a href='#f899' class='c012'><sup>[899]</sup></a> and
Atticus amongst the number of his friends.<a id='r900' /><a href='#f900' class='c012'><sup>[900]</sup></a> These circumstances
constitute all that is known respecting his personal history.</p>

<p class='c011'>All his works which are mentioned by the ancients are unfortunately
lost; but respecting the genuineness of that with which
every scholar is familiar from his childhood, strong doubts have
been entertained. His lost works were, (1.) Three books of
Chronicles, or a short abridgment of Universal History. They
are mentioned by A. Gellius,<a id='r901' /><a href='#f901' class='c012'><sup>[901]</sup></a> and allusion is made to them by
Catullus.<a id='r902' /><a href='#f902' class='c012'><sup>[902]</sup></a> (2.) Five books of anecdotes styled “<cite class='quote'>Libri Exemplorum</cite>,”<a id='r903' /><a href='#f903' class='c012'><sup>[903]</sup></a>
and also entitled “<cite class='quote'>The Book of C. Nepos <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Viris illustribus</span></i></cite>.”
(3.) A Life of Cicero,<a id='r904' /><a href='#f904' class='c012'><sup>[904]</sup></a> and a collection of Letters addressed
to him.<a id='r905' /><a href='#f905' class='c012'><sup>[905]</sup></a> (4.) “<cite class='quote'>De Historicis</cite>,” or Memoirs of Historians.<a id='r906' /><a href='#f906' class='c012'><sup>[906]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>The work now extant which bears his name is entitled “<cite class='quote'>The
Lives of Eminent Generals</cite>.” But besides the biographies of
twenty generals, it contains short accounts of some celebrated
monarchs, lives of Hamilcar and Hannibal, and also of Cato and
Atticus. The Proëmium of the book is addressed to one Atticus,
and to the first edition was prefixed a dedication to the Emperor
Theodosius, from which it appeared that the author’s name was
Probus. These biographical sketches continued to be ascribed
to this unknown author until the latter half of the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p class='c011'>At that time the celebrated scholar Lambinus, Regius Professor
of Belles Lettres at Paris, argued from the purity of the
style that it was a work of classical antiquity, and, from a passage
in the life of Cato, that the Atticus, to whom it was dedicated,
was the well-known correspondent of Cicero, and the
author no other than Cornelius Nepos. The argument derived
from the Latinity is unanswerable; that, however, from the life
of Cato is a “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">petitio principii</span></i>,” inasmuch as there is no more
evidence in favour of the life of Cato having been written by
Nepos, than the other biographies. The life of Atticus, which
is a complete model of biographical composition, is ascribed to
him by name in some of the best MSS. Of the rest nothing
more can be affirmed with certainty, than that they are a work,
or the epitome of a work, belonging to the Augustan age.</p>

<p class='c011'>The strongest evidence which exists in favour of the authorship
of C. Nepos, is that Jerome Magius, a contemporary of Lambinus,
who also published an annotated edition of the “<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vitæ
Illustrium Imperatorum</span></cite>,” found a MS. with the following conclusion:
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Completum est opus Æmilii Probi Cornelii Nepotis.</span>”
These words would seem to assert the authorship of Nepos, and
at the same time to admit that Probus was the editor or epitomator,
and thus support the theory of Lambinus, without accusing
Probus of a literary forgery.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>C. Julius Cæsar</span> (<span class='fss'>BORN B. C.</span> 100.)</h4>

<p class='c018'>To give a biographical account of Cæsar would be, in fact,
nothing less than to trace the contemporary history of Rome; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>Roman history had now become the history of those master-minds
who seized upon, or were invested by their countrymen with,
supreme power. Although the rapid and energetic talents of
Cæsar never permitted him to lose a day, his active devotion to
the truly Roman employments of politics and war, left him little
time for sedentary occupations. His literary biography, therefore,
will necessarily occupy but a short space, compared with
the other great events of his career.</p>

<p class='c011'>C. Julius Cæsar was descended from a family of the Julian
<i>gens</i>, one of the oldest among the patrician families of Rome, of
which all but a very few had by this time become extinct. The
Cæsar family was not only of patrician descent, but numbered
amongst its members, during the century which preceded the
birth of the Dictator, many who had served curule offices with
great distinction. He was born on the 4th of the ides of July
(the 12th,) <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 100, and attached himself, both by politics and
by matrimonial connexion to the popular party: his good taste,
great tact, and pleasing manners, contributed, together with his
talents, to insure his popularity. He became a soldier in the
nineteenth year of his age; and hence his works display all the
best qualities which are fostered by a military education, and
which therefore characterize the military profession—frankness,
simplicity, and brevity. He served his first campaign at the
conclusion of the first Mithridatic war, during which he was
present at the siege and capture of Mitylene,<a id='r907' /><a href='#f907' class='c012'><sup>[907]</sup></a> and received the
honour of a civic crown for saving the life of a citizen.</p>

<p class='c011'>His earliest literary triumph was as an orator. Cn. Dolabella
was suspected of oppressive extortion in the administration of his
province of Macedonia, and Cæsar came forward as his accuser.
The celebrated Hortensius was the advocate for the accused;
and although Cæsar did not gain his cause, the skill and eloquence
which he displayed as a pleader gave promise of his becoming
hereafter a consummate orator. The following year he
increased his reputation by taking up the cause of the province
of Achaia against C. Antonius, who was accused of the same
crime as Dolabella; but he was again unsuccessful in the result.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>He subsequently sailed for Rhodes, in order to pursue the
study of oratory under the direction of Apollonius Molon,<a id='r908' /><a href='#f908' class='c012'><sup>[908]</sup></a> who
was not only a teacher of rhetoric, but also an able and eloquent
pleader in the courts of law. Cicero<a id='r909' /><a href='#f909' class='c012'><sup>[909]</sup></a> bears testimony to his
being a skilful instructor and an eloquent speaker, and received
instruction from him when he came to Rome as an ambassador
from Rhodes.<a id='r910' /><a href='#f910' class='c012'><sup>[910]</sup></a> Cæsar, on his voyage, was captured by pirates;
but after he was ransomed, he carried his intention into effect,
and placed himself for a short time under the tuition of Molon.
After his return to Rome,<a id='r911' /><a href='#f911' class='c012'><sup>[911]</sup></a> a proposition was made to recall from
exile those of the party of Lepidus, who had joined Sertorius,
and he spoke in favour of the measure. Two years subsequently
he delivered funeral orations in praise of his wife Cornelia, who
was the daughter of Cinna, and his aunt Julia, the widow of
Marius.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Catilinarian conspiracy, in which, without reason, he was
suspected of having been concerned, furnished him with another
opportunity of displaying his ability as an orator. His speech
in the senate on the celebrated nones of December, would probably
have saved the lives of the conspirators, had not Cato’s influence
prevailed. Cæsar pleaded that it was unconstitutional to
put Roman citizens to death by the vote of the senate, without a
trial; but his arguments were overruled, and the measure which
subsequently led to the fall and assassination of Cicero was carried.
The following year,<a id='r912' /><a href='#f912' class='c012'><sup>[912]</sup></a> when Metellus made this a subject
of accusation against Cicero, Cæsar again supported the same
view with his eloquence, but was unsuccessful.</p>

<p class='c011'>Great, therefore, although it is said that his talents as an orator
were, he never appears to have convinced his hearers. This
may have been owing, not to deficiency in skill, but to the unfortunate
nature of the causes which he took in hand, or to the
superior powers of his opponents, for there is no doubt that his
manner of speaking was most engaging and popular. Tacitus
speaks of him not only as the greatest of authors,<a id='r913' /><a href='#f913' class='c012'><sup>[913]</sup></a> but also as
rivalling the most accomplished orators;<a id='r914' /><a href='#f914' class='c012'><sup>[914]</sup></a> whilst Suetonius praises
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>his eloquence, and quotes the testimony of Cicero himself in support
of his favourable criticism.<a id='r915' /><a href='#f915' class='c012'><sup>[915]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Hitherto, with the exception of his first campaign, the life of
Cæsar was of a civil complexion. His literary eminence took
the colouring of the public occupations in which he was engaged.
Like a true Roman, literature was subordinate to public duty,
and his taste was directed into the channel which was most akin
to, and identified with, his life. His intellectual vigour, however,
demanded employment as well as his practical talents for business;
and for this reason, as has been seen, he devoted himself
to the study of oratory; and the principal works which as yet
obtain for him a place in a history of Roman literature are
merely orations.</p>

<p class='c011'>His next official appointment opened to him a new field for
thought. In <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 63 he obtained the office of Pontifex Maximus,
and examined so diligently into the history and nature of the
Roman belief in augury, of which he was the official guardian,
that his investigations were published in a work consisting of at
least sixteen books (<cite>Libri Auspiciorum</cite>.<a id='r916' /><a href='#f916' class='c012'><sup>[916]</sup></a>) In order to fit himself
for discharging the duties of his office he studied astronomy,
and even wrote a treatise on that science,<a id='r917' /><a href='#f917' class='c012'><sup>[917]</sup></a> entitled “<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Astris</span></cite>”,
and a poem somewhat resembling the Phenomena of Aratus.
His knowledge of this science enabled him, with the aid of the
Alexandrian astronomers, to carry into effect some years<a id='r918' /><a href='#f918' class='c012'><sup>[918]</sup></a> afterwards
the reformation of the calendar.</p>

<p class='c011'>The works above mentioned are philosophically and scientifically
valueless, but curious and interesting; but we have now to
view Cæsar in that capacity which was the foundation of his literary
reputation. He obtained the province of Hispania Ulterior;<a id='r919' /><a href='#f919' class='c012'><sup>[919]</sup></a>
and at this post his career as a military commander began.
As had been the case during his previous career, so now the almost
incessant demands on his thoughts and time did not divert
him from literary pursuits, but determined the channel in which
his tastes should seek satisfaction, and furnished the subject for
his pen. He had evidently an ardent love for literature for its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>own sake. It was not the paltry ambition of showing that he
could achieve success, and, even superiority, in every thing which
he chose to undertake, although his versatility of talent was such
as to encourage him to expect success, but a real attachment to
literary employment. Hence whatever leisure his duties as a
military commander permitted him to enjoy was devoted, as to
a labour of love, to the composition of his Memoirs or Commentaries
of the Gallic and Civil Wars.</p>

<p class='c011'>His comprehensive and liberal mind was also convinced of the
embarrassing technicalities which impeded the administration
of the Roman law. Its interpretation was confined to a few who
had studied its pedantic mysteries; and the laws which regulated
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dies fasti</span></i> and <i>nefasti</i> had originally placed its administration
in the hands of the priests and patricians. Appius Claudius had
already commenced the work of demolishing the fences which
to the people at large were impregnable; and Cæsar entertained
the grand design of reducing its principles and practice to a regular
code.<a id='r920' /><a href='#f920' class='c012'><sup>[920]</sup></a> His views he imbodied in a treatise,<a id='r921' /><a href='#f921' class='c012'><sup>[921]</sup></a> which, as is
often the case with pamphlets, perished when the object ceased
to exist for which it was intended.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is said that he also contemplated a complete survey and
map of the Roman empire.<a id='r922' /><a href='#f922' class='c012'><sup>[922]</sup></a> But his greatest benefaction, perhaps,
to the cause of Roman literature was the establishment of
a public library.<a id='r923' /><a href='#f923' class='c012'><sup>[923]</sup></a> The spoils of Italy, collected by Asinius
Pollio, furnished the materials, just as the museums of Paris
were enriched by the great modern conqueror from the plunder
of Europe; but it was, nevertheless, a great and patriotic work;
and he enhanced its utility by intrusting the collection and arrangement
of it to the learned Varro as librarian.</p>

<p class='c011'>Besides the works already named, Cæsar left behind him
various letters, some of which are extant amongst those of Cicero;
orations, of which, if the panegyrics of Cicero, Tacitus, and
Quintilian<a id='r924' /><a href='#f924' class='c012'><sup>[924]</sup></a> are not exaggerated, it is deeply to be regretted
that the titles are alone preserved;<a id='r925' /><a href='#f925' class='c012'><sup>[925]</sup></a> a short treatise or pamphlet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>called <cite><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Anticato</span></cite>; a work on the analogy of the Latin language;
a collection of apothegms; and a few poems.</p>

<p class='c011'>These are the grounds on which the claims of the great conqueror
to literary fame rest in the various capacities of orator,
historian, antiquarian, philosopher, grammarian, and poet; but
by far the most important of his works is his “<cite class='quote'>Commentaries</cite>.”
These have fortunately come down to us in a tolerably perfect
state, although much still remains to be done before we can be
said to possess an accurate edition.<a id='r926' /><a href='#f926' class='c012'><sup>[926]</sup></a> Seven books contain the
history of seven years of the Gallic war, and three carry the
history of the civil war down to the commencement of the Alexandrine.
These are the works of Cæsar himself. The eighth
book, “<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Bello Gallico</span></cite>,” which completes the subject, and the
three supplemental books of the work, “<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Bello Civili</span></cite>,” which
contain the Alexandrine, African, and Spanish wars, have been
variously ascribed to the friends of Cæsar, A. Hirtius, C. Oppius,
and even to Pansa. The claims of the latter, however, are entirely
groundless. The marked similarity between the style of
the eighth book of the Gallic war and that of the Alexandrine
war proves that they were written by the same author; and from
the elegance and purity of the Latinity, and the confidential
footing on which the author must have been with Cæsar, there
is a probability, almost amounting to a certainty, that the History
of the Alexandrine War must be the work of A. Hirtius. It
may also be remarked that this opinion is in unison with that of
Suetonius.<a id='r927' /><a href='#f927' class='c012'><sup>[927]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Hirtius was the only one of the three who united in himself
both these important qualifications. C. Oppius was indeed
equally in the confidence of Cæsar; he was his inseparable companion.<a id='r928' /><a href='#f928' class='c012'><sup>[928]</sup></a>
But, nevertheless, Oppius was not so highly educated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>as Hirtius. Niebuhr, therefore, is probably correct in attributing
to him, “without hesitation,”<a id='r929' /><a href='#f929' class='c012'><sup>[929]</sup></a> the book on the African war. The
intelligence and information displayed in it are worthy of the
sensible soldier and confidential friend, with whom he corresponded
in cipher, and whom he intrusted with writing the introduction
to his defence in the “<cite class='quote'>Anticato</cite>;” whilst the inferiority
of the language marks a less skilful and practised hand than
that of the refined Hirtius. The book on the Spanish war is by
some unknown author: it is founded on a diary kept by some
one engaged in the war; but neither its language nor sentiments
are those of a liberally educated person.<a id='r930' /><a href='#f930' class='c012'><sup>[930]</sup></a> The Greek term
“<cite class='quote'>Ephemerides</cite>” has sometimes been applied to the “<cite class='quote'>Commentaries</cite>,”
though Bayle<a id='r931' /><a href='#f931' class='c012'><sup>[931]</sup></a> thought that they were different works.</p>

<p class='c011'>These memoirs are exactly what they profess to be, and are
written in the most appropriate style. Few would wish it to be
other than it is. They are sketches taken on the spot, in the
midst of action, whilst the mind was full: they have all the graphic
power of a master-mind, and the vigorous touches of a
master-hand. Take, for example, the delineation of the Gallic
character, and compare it with some of the features still to be
found in the mixed race, their successors, and no one can doubt
of its accuracy, or of the deep and penetrating insight into human
nature which generally indicates the powerful and practical intellect.
Their elegance and polish is that which always mark
even the least-laboured efforts of a refined and educated taste,
not that which proceeds from careful emendation and correction.
The “<cite class='quote'>Commentaries</cite>” are the materials for history; notes jotted
down for future historians. It is evident that no more time was
spent upon them than would naturally be devoted to such a work
by one who was employing the inaction of winter quarters in
digesting the recollections stored up during the business of the
campaign; and for this reason few faults have been found with
the “<cite class='quote'>Commentaries</cite>,” even by the most fastidious critics. The
very faults which may be justly found with the style of Cæsar
are such as reflect the man himself. The majesty of his character
principally consists in the imperturbable calmness and equability
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>of his temper. He had no sudden bursts of energy, and alternations
of passion and inactivity: the elevation of his character
was a high one, but it was a level table-land. This calmness and
equability pervades his writings, and for this reason they have
been thought to want life and energy; whereas in reality they
are only deficient in contrast, and light and shade. The uniformity
of his active character is interesting as one great element
of his success; but the uniformity of style may perhaps be thought
by some readers to diminish the interest with which his work is
read.</p>

<p class='c011'>The simple beauty of his language is, as Cicero says, statuesque
rather than picturesque. Simple, severe, naked—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">omni ornatu
orationis tanquam veste detracto</span>;” and whilst, like a statue, it
conveys the idea of perfect and well-proportioned beauty, it
banishes all thoughts of human passion. It was this perfect
calm propriety, perhaps this absence of all ornamental display,
which prevented him from being a successful orator, and his
orations from surviving, although he had every external qualification
for a speaker<a id='r932' /><a href='#f932' class='c012'><sup>[932]</sup></a>—a fine voice, graceful action, a noble and
majestic appearance, and a frank and brilliant delivery.</p>

<p class='c011'>The very few instances of doubtful Latinity which a hypercritical
spirit may detect are scarcely blemishes, and fewer than
might have been expected from the observation of Hirtius,<a id='r933' /><a href='#f933' class='c012'><sup>[933]</sup></a>
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ceteri quam bene atque emendate, nos etiam, quam facile ac
celeriter eos perscripserit, scimus</span>.” When A. Pollio<a id='r934' /><a href='#f934' class='c012'><sup>[934]</sup></a> called his
“<cite class='quote'>Commentaries</cite>” hasty, his criticism was fair; but he was scarcely
just in blaming the writer for inaccuracy and credulity. These
faults, so far as they existed, were due to circumstances, not to
himself. His observing mind wished to collect information with
respect to the foreign lands which were the field of his exploits,
and the habits of the inhabitants, quite as much as to describe
his own tactics and victories. He naturally accepted the accounts
given him, even when he had no means of testing their veracity.
He is, therefore, not to blame for recording those which subsequent
discoveries have shown to be untrue.</p>

<p class='c011'>His digressions of this character yield in interest to no portion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>of his work; and though some of his accounts of the Gauls and
Germans are incorrect, many were subsequently confirmed by
the investigations of Tacitus. The only quality in the character
of Cæsar which has been sometimes exaggerated is modesty. He
does not, indeed, add to his own reputation by detracting from
the merits of those who served under him. He is honest, generous,
and candid, not only towards them, but also towards his
brave barbarian enemies. Nor is he guilty of egotism in the
strict literal sense of the term. This, however, is scarcely enough
to warrant the eulogy which some have founded upon it. He
has too good taste to recount his successes with pretension and
arrogance; but he has evidently no objection to be the hero of
his own tale. He skilfully veils his selfish, unpatriotic, and
ambitious motives; and his object evidently is to leave such
memoirs, that future historians may be able to hand down the
most favourable character of Cæsar to posterity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Though himself is his subject, his memoirs are not confessions.
Not a record of a weakness appears, nor even of a defect, except
that which the Romans would readily forgive, cruelty. His
savage waste of human life he recounts with perfect self-complacency.
Vanity was his crowning error in his career as a statesman;
and though hidden by the reserve with which he speaks
of himself, it sometimes discovers itself in the historian.</p>

<p class='c011'>The “<cite class='quote'>Commentaries</cite>” of Cæsar have sometimes been compared
with the work of the great soldier historian of Greece, Xenophon.
Both are eminently simple and unaffected; but there the parallel
ends. The severe contempt of ornament which characterizes
the stern Roman is totally unlike the mellifluous sweetness of
the Attic writer.</p>

<p class='c011'>The “<cite class='quote'>Anticatones</cite>”<a id='r935' /><a href='#f935' class='c012'><sup>[935]</sup></a> were two books in answer to Cicero’s
panegyric of Cato, which he had written immediately after the
philosopher’s death. Hirtius first, at the request of Cæsar, wrote
a reply, and sent it to Cicero from Narbonne. Although he
denied the justice of Cicero’s eulogium, he secured the good-will
of the orator himself by liberal commendations.<a id='r936' /><a href='#f936' class='c012'><sup>[936]</sup></a> This prepared
the way for Cæsar’s own pamphlet.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>His philological work, <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Analogia</span></cite>, or <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">de Ratione Latine Loquendi</span></cite>,
is commended by Cicero<a id='r937' /><a href='#f937' class='c012'><sup>[937]</sup></a> for its extreme accuracy, and
was held in high estimation by the Roman grammarians. Probably,
in liveliness and originality, it was far superior to any of
their works. Wonderful to say, it was written during the difficulties
and occupations of a journey across the Alps. From the
quotations from it, in the writings of the grammarians, we learn
that he proposed that the letter V should be written Ⅎ, to mark
its connexion with the Greek digamma; and that the new orthography,
which substituted <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lacrimæ</span></i> for <i>lucrumæ</i>, <i>maximus</i> for
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">maxumus</span></i>, &amp;c., was established by his authority.</p>

<p class='c011'>The “<cite>Apophthegmata</cite>” is said to have been a collection of wise
and witty sayings by himself and others, although it is remarkable
not a single witty saying of Cæsar is on record.<a id='r938' /><a href='#f938' class='c012'><sup>[938]</sup></a> He began
it early in life, and was continually making additions to it.</p>

<p class='c011'>His poetical attempts consisted of a tragedy entitled “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Œdipus</span></cite>;”
a short piece, the subject of which was the praises of Hercules
(both of these, as well as the Apophthegmata, were suppressed
by Augustus;<a id='r939' /><a href='#f939' class='c012'><sup>[939]</sup></a>) “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Iter</span></cite>,” an account of his march into Spain; the
astronomical poem already mentioned; and some epigrams, of
which three are extant, although their authenticity is somewhat
doubtful.<a id='r940' /><a href='#f940' class='c012'><sup>[940]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The character of Cæsar is full of inconsistencies; but they are
the inconsistencies which are natural to man, and are sometimes
found in men of a strong will and commanding talents who are
destitute of moral principle. His faults and excellences, his capability
and talents, were the result of his natural powers—not
of pains or study. He was one of the greatest as well as one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>the worst men who ever lived. He was an Epicurean in faith,
and yet he had all the superstition which so often accompanies
infidelity. His habitual humanity and clemency towards his
fellow-citizens were interrupted by instances of stern and pitiless
cruelty. He shed tears at the assassination of Pompey, and yet
could massacre the Usipetes and the Tenchteri, and acted like a
savage barbarian towards his chivalrous foe Vercingetorix. He
delighted in the pure and refined pleasures of literature, and
his intimate associates were men of taste and genius; and yet he
was the slave of his sensual passions, and indulged in the grossest
profligacy. He was candid, friendly, confiding, generous; but
he was attracted by brilliant talents, and the qualities of the
head, rather than the affections of the heart. The mainspring
of his conduct as a general and a statesman exhibits a strong
will and perfect self-reliance; and in like manner he owes the
energy of his style of writing, and the persuasive force of his
oratory, to the influence of no other minds: they are the natural
fruit of clear perceptions, a penetrating intellect, an observing
mind capable of taking a wide and comprehensive view of its
subject. Men of varied acquirements and extensive knowledge,
but of pedantic taste, are said to talk like books; the writings of
Cæsar, on the contrary, are like lively and unconstrained conversation:
they have all the reality which constitutes the great
charm of his character.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was above affectation, for his was a mind born to lead the
age in which he lived, not to think with others merely in deference
to established usage and custom; and although his natural
vanity and self-confidence led him to set his own character in
the most favourable light, his vanity was honest: he had no intention
wilfully to deceive. His wonderful memory fitted him
for the task of faithfully recording the events in which he himself
was an actor; and his power of attention and abstraction,
which enabled him to write, converse, and dictate at the same
time, shows how valuable must be a work on which were concentrated
at once all the energies of his penetrating mind.</p>

</div>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>C. Sallustius Crispus</span> (<span class='fss'>BORN B. C.</span> 85.)</h4>

<p class='c018'>C. Sallustius Crispus was fifteen years junior to Cæsar: he
was born at Amiternum<a id='r941' /><a href='#f941' class='c012'><sup>[941]</sup></a> in the territory of the Sabines, <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;C.</span>
669, <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 85. He was a member of a plebeian family; but,
having served the offices of tribune and quæstor, attained senatorial
rank. In <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;U.&nbsp;C.</span> 704, he was expelled from the senate<a id='r942' /><a href='#f942' class='c012'><sup>[942]</sup></a>
by the censors Ap. Claudius Pulcher and L. Calpurnius Piso.<a id='r943' /><a href='#f943' class='c012'><sup>[943]</sup></a>
It is said that, although he was “a most severe censurer of the
licentiousness of others,”<a id='r944' /><a href='#f944' class='c012'><sup>[944]</sup></a> he was a profligate man himself,
and that the scandal of an intrigue with Fausta, the daughter of
Sulla and the wife of Milo, was the cause of his degradation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Through the influence of Cæsar, whose party he espoused, he
was restored to his rank, and subsequently became prætor. He
accompanied his patron in the African war, and was made governor
of Numidia. Whilst in that capacity, he accumulated
by rapacity and extortion enormous wealth,<a id='r945' /><a href='#f945' class='c012'><sup>[945]</sup></a> which he lavished
on expensive but tasteful luxury. The gardens on the Quirinal
which bore his name were celebrated for their beauty; and beneath
their alleys, and porticoes, surrounded by the choicest
works of art, he avoided the tumultuous scenes of civil strife
which ushered in the empire, and devoted his retirement to composing
the historical records which survived him. His death
took place <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 35.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>Those who have wished to defend the character of Sallust from
the charges of immorality, to which allusion has been made,
have attributed them to the groundless calumnies of Lenæus, a
freedman of Cæsar’s great rival Pompey. It is not improbable
that his faults may have been exaggerated by the malevolence of
party-spirit in those factious times; but there are no sentiments
in his works which can constitute a defence of him. If an
historian is distinguished by a high moral tone of feeling, this
quality cannot but show itself in his writings without intention
or design. But in Sallust there is always an affectation and pretence
of morality without the reality. His philosophical reflections
at the commencement of the Jugurthine and Catilinarian
wars are empty, cold, and heartless. There is a display of commonplace
sentiment, and an expressed admiration of the old
Roman virtue of bygone days, but no appearance of sincerity.
The language may be pointed enough to produce an effect upon
the ear, but the sentiments always fail to probe the recesses of
the heart. Sallust lived in an immoral and corrupt age; and
though, perhaps, he was not amongst the worst of his contemporaries,
he had not sufficient strength of principle to resist the
force of example and temptation.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is almost certain that, as a provincial governor, Sallust was
not more unscrupulous than others of his class; but wealth such
as he possessed could not have been acquired except by extortion
and maladministration. As a politician, he was equally
unsatisfactory: he was a mere partisan of Cæsar, and therefore,
a strenuous opponent of the higher classes as supporters of
Pompey; but he was not an honest champion of popular rights,
nor was he capable of understanding the meaning of patriotism.
If, however, we make some allowance for the political bias of
Sallust, which is evident throughout his works, his histories have
not only the charms of the historical romance, but are also valuable
political studies. His characters are vigorously and naturally
drawn, as though he not only personally knew them, but
accurately understood them. The more his histories are read
the more will it be discovered that he always writes with an
object. He eschews the very idea of a mere dry chronicle of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>facts, and uses his facts as the means of enforcing a great political
lesson.</p>

<p class='c011'>For this reason, like Thucydides, whom he evidently took
as his model, not only in style but in the use of his materials,
his speeches are his own compositions. Even when he had an
opportunity, as in the case of Cæsar’s and Cato’s speeches in the
“<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bellum Catilinarium</span></cite>,” he contented himself with giving the
substance of them, clothed it in his own language, and imbodied
in them his own sentiments. According to his own statement,
there is one exception to his practice in this respect. He asserts
that the speech of Memmius, the tribune of the people,<a id='r946' /><a href='#f946' class='c012'><sup>[946]</sup></a> is the
very one which he delivered. If this be really the case, it is a
most valuable example of the style in which a popular leader addressed
his audience. But it is to be feared that this is not
strictly and literally true: the style is indeed somewhat different
from that of the other speeches, but does not exhibit freedom
enough to assure us that he has actually reported it as delivered.
It may be only a specimen of that consummate skill which
constitutes the principal charm of Sallust’s manner, and made
him a complete master of composition. Sallust never attempted
anything more than detached portions of Roman history.
“I have determined,” he says, “to write only select portions of
Roman history,” (carptim perscribere.<a id='r947' /><a href='#f947' class='c012'><sup>[947]</sup></a>) He himself gives an
explanation of his motives for so doing,<a id='r948' /><a href='#f948' class='c012'><sup>[948]</sup></a> when he complains of
the manner in which this department of literature was neglected.
Wherever a satisfactory account existed, he thought it unnecessary
to travel over the same ground a second time.</p>

<p class='c011'>His first work, reckoning according to the chronological order
of events, is the Jugurthine war, which commenced <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 111,
and ended <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 106. The next period, comprehending the social
war and the war of Sulla, extending as far as the consulship
of M. Æmilius Lepidus, <span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 78, had already been related by
Sisenna, a friend of Cicero.<a id='r949' /><a href='#f949' class='c012'><sup>[949]</sup></a> Where Sisenna left off, the Histories
of Sallust (Historiarum Libri V.) began, and continued
the narrative without interruption until the prætorship of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>Cicero.<a id='r950' /><a href='#f950' class='c012'><sup>[950]</sup></a> This work is unfortunately lost, with the exception of
some letters and speeches, and a few fragments relating to the war
of Spartacus. Niebuhr<a id='r951' /><a href='#f951' class='c012'><sup>[951]</sup></a> considers this one of the most deplorable
losses in Roman literature; less, however, on account of its historical
importance, than as a perfect model of historical composition.
A break of two years ensues, and then follows the
“<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bellum Catilinarium</span></cite>,” or history of the Catilinarian conspiracy
in the year of Cicero’s consulship.<a id='r952' /><a href='#f952' class='c012'><sup>[952]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>This completes the list of those works which are undoubtedly
genuine. No satisfactory opinion has been arrived at respecting
the authorship of the two letters to Cæsar, “<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Republicâ Ordinandâ</span></cite>;”
and it is now unhesitatingly admitted, that the declamation
against Cicero, must have been, as well as its counterpart,
the declamation against Sallust, the work of some rhetorical
writer of a later period. The subject of this imaginary disputation
was naturally suggested by the known fact that Sallust
was no friend to Cicero.</p>

<p class='c011'>It has already been stated that Sallust was a bitter opponent
of the principles and policy of the aristocratic party; but it must
be carefully explained what is meant by that assertion. The
object of his hatred was not the old patrician blood of Rome,
but the new aristocracy, which had of late years been rapidly
rising up and displacing it.</p>

<p class='c011'>This new nobility was utterly corrupt; and their corruption
was encouraged by the venality of the masses, whose poverty
and destitution tempted them to be the tools of unscrupulous
ambition. Everything at Rome, as Juvenal said in later times,
had its price. Sallust adds to the severity of his strictures upon
his countrymen by the force of contrast; he represents even
Jugurtha as asserting that the republic itself might be bought,
if a purchaser could be found; and paints the barbarian as more
honest and upright than his conquerors. The ruined and abandoned
associates of Catiline represented a numerous class among
the younger members of the upper classes, who, by lives devoted
to lawless pleasures, had become ruined, reckless, and demoralized.
They were ripe for revolution, because they had nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>to lose: they could not gratify their vicious propensities without
wealth; they had no principles or scruples as to the means of
acquiring it; their best prospects were in anarchy, proscription,
and confiscation. The debauched and ruined nobleman,
and the vulgar profligate of the lowest class, forgot their
mutual differences, and thus a combination was formed, the
members of which were the sink and outscourings of society.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such degenerate profligacy is an ample justification of Sallust’s
hatred towards the new aristocracy; and the object of all
his works evidently was to place that party in the unfavourable
light which it deserved. In the Jugurthine war he describes
the unworthiness of the foreign policy of Rome under its maladministration.
His “<cite class='quote'>Histories</cite>,” according to the statement of
Niebuhr, describe the popular resistance to the revolutionary
policy of Sulla, the profligate leader of the same party; and
in the “<cite class='quote'>Catilinarian war</cite>” he paints in vivid colours the depravity
of that order of society, who, bankrupt in fortune and dead
to all honourable feelings, still plumed themselves on their rank
and exclusiveness. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the truthfulness
of the picture which Sallust draws, selfishness and not patriotism
was the mainspring of his politics; and it is scarcely possible
to avoid seeing that he is anxious to set himself off to
the best advantage. His hollowness is that of a vain and conceited
man, who measures himself by too high a standard, and
appears chagrined and disappointed that others do not estimate
him as highly as he does himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>These are the blots in his character as a man and a citizen;
but we must not forget his real merits as an historian. To him
must be conceded the praise of having first conceived the notion
of a history in the true sense of the term. He saw the
lamentable defects in the abortive attempts made by his predecessors;<a id='r953' /><a href='#f953' class='c012'><sup>[953]</sup></a>
and the model was a good one which he left for his
successors to follow. It is scarcely too much to suppose, that if
it had not been for Sallust, Livy might not have been led to
conceive his vast and comprehensive plan. He was the first
Roman historian, and the guide to future historians. Again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>his style, although almost ostentatiously elaborate and artificial,
and not without affectation, is, upon the whole, pleasing, and
almost always transparently clear. The caution of Quintilian
respecting his well-known brevity (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vitanda est illa Sallustiana
brevitas</span>”<a id='r954' /><a href='#f954' class='c012'><sup>[954]</sup></a>) is well-timed in his work, as being addressed to orators,
for public speaking necessarily requires a more diffuse
style; and it is probable that Quintilian would not appreciate
its merits, because he himself was a rhetorician, and his taste
was formed in a rhetorical age. Seneca, for the same reasons,
finds similar faults, not only with Sallust, but with the favourite
literature of his day. “When Sallust flourished, abrupt sentences,
unexpected cadences, obscure expressions, were considered
signs of a cultivated taste.”<a id='r955' /><a href='#f955' class='c012'><sup>[955]</sup></a> But the brevity of Sallust
does not produce the effect of harsh or disagreeable abruptness,
whilst it keeps the attention awake, and impresses the facts upon
the memory. How powerful and suggestive, for example, how
abundant in material for thought, are those few words in which
he describes Pompey as “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">oris probi, animo inverecundo!</span>” There
is, however, this difference between the brevity of Sallust and
that of his supposed model, Thucydides. That of the Greek
historian was natural and involuntary; that of the Roman intentional
and the result of imitation. Thucydides thought more
quickly than he could write: his closely-packed ideas and condensed
constructions, therefore, constitute a species of shorthand,
by which alone he could keep pace with the rapidity of
his intellect. He is, therefore, always vigorous and suggestive;
and the necessities of the case make the reader readily pardon
the difficulties of his style.</p>

<p class='c011'>The brevity of Thucydides is the result of condensation; that
of Sallust is elliptical expression. He gives a hint and the
reader must supply the rest; whilst Thucydides only expects his
readers to unfold and develop ideas which already existed in a
concentrated form. Sallust requires addition; Thucydides dilution
and expansion. Neither does the brevity of Sallust resemble
that of Cæsar or of Tacitus: the former was straight-forward
and business-like, requiring neither addition nor expansion,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>because he wished to make his statements as clear as
they were capable of being expressed, without ornament or exaggeration.
He was brief, because he never wished to say
more than was absolutely necessary, and therefore his brevity
is the very cause of perspicuity. The mind of Tacitus was,
from its thoughtfulness and philosophical character, the very
counterpart of that of Thucydides: his brevity was therefore
natural and the result of the same causes.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is one point of view in which Sallust is invaluable as
an historian. He had always an object to which he wished all
his facts to converge: he brought forward his facts as illustrations
and developments of principles. He analyzed and exposed
the motives of parties, and the secret springs which actuated the
conduct of individuals, and laid bare the inner life of those great
actors on the public stage, in the interesting historical scenes
which he undertakes to describe.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Trogus Pompeius.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Trogus Pompeius was a voluminous historian of the Augustan
age, whose father was private secretary to Julius Cæsar.<a id='r956' /><a href='#f956' class='c012'><sup>[956]</sup></a> His
work was of such vast extent, and embraced so great a variety
of subjects, that it has even been termed by Justin, who published
a large collection of extracts from it, <i>an Universal History</i>. Its
title, however, “<cite>Historiæ Philippicæ</cite>,” proves the writer’s primary
object was the history of the Macedonian monarchy, together
with the kingdoms which arose out of it at the death of
Alexander; and that all the rest of the information contained in
it were digressions into which he was naturally led, and episodes
incidentally introduced into the main stream of the history.</p>

<p class='c011'>For the materials contained in his work, which consisted of
forty-four books, he was indebted to the Greek historians, but
especially to Theopompus of Chios,<a id='r957' /><a href='#f957' class='c012'><sup>[957]</sup></a> from whose principal work
he derived the title, “<cite>Philippica</cite>,” as well as the practice of
branching out into long and frequent digressions. It is easy to
imagine over how vast an area a history of the Macedonian empire
was capable of extending. The subjugation of the East
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>by the conquests of Alexander naturally made a rapid sketch of
the Assyrian, Median, and Persian empires, an appropriate introduction
to the work: the connexion of Persia with Greece
and Egypt furnished an opportunity of imbodying the records
of Greek history, and a description of Egypt and its inhabitants.
Once embarked in Greek history, the writer pursued it until it
became interwoven, through the interference of Philip, with the
affairs of Macedon. Alexander and his successors succeed: the
campaigns of Pyrrhus bring the Romans upon the stage; Carthage
and Sicily for awhile occupy the scene; and the main
body of the work is completed by a sketch of the gradual consolidation
of that vast empire, of which subjugated Macedonia
became a province. Nor is this all—other less important nations,
states, and cities are ever and anon introduced, according
as they act their part in the great drama of history.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>T. Livius Patavinus</span> (<span class='fss'>BORN B. C.</span> 59.)</h4>

<p class='c018'>The biographical records of many great literary men of Rome
are most meager and unsatisfactory. Modern critics who have
written their lives have drawn largely upon their own imaginations
for their materials; whilst all the information to be derived
from ancient writers is often comprised in a few vague allusions
and notices. Some of these have been misunderstood, and from
others unwarrantable deductions have been derived. These observations
are particularly applicable to him who is the only illustrious
Roman historian in the Augustan age.</p>

<p class='c011'>Universal tradition assigns to Patavium (Padua) the honour
of being the birthplace of Titus Livius; but notwithstanding the
general belief, some doubt has been thrown upon the fact by an
epigram of Martial.<a id='r958' /><a href='#f958' class='c012'><sup>[958]</sup></a> He came to Rome during the reign of
Augustus, where he resided in the enjoyment of the imperial
favour and patronage.<a id='r959' /><a href='#f959' class='c012'><sup>[959]</sup></a> He was a warm and open admirer of
the ancient institutions of the country, and esteemed Pompey
as one of its greatest heroes; but Augustus, with his usual liberality,
did not allow political opinions to interfere with the regard
which he entertained for the historian. Livy had a great
admiration for oratory, and advised his son to study the writings
of Demosthenes and Cicero.<a id='r960' /><a href='#f960' class='c012'><sup>[960]</sup></a> At his recommendation the stupid
Claudius wrote history;<a id='r961' /><a href='#f961' class='c012'><sup>[961]</sup></a> and it has even been asserted, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>on insufficient authority, that he was his instructor. His fame
rapidly spread beyond the limits of Italy, for Pliny the younger<a id='r962' /><a href='#f962' class='c012'><sup>[962]</sup></a>
relates that an inhabitant of Cadiz came to Rome for the express
purpose of seeing him; a fact which St. Jerome<a id='r963' /><a href='#f963' class='c012'><sup>[963]</sup></a> expands into an
assertion that many noble Gauls and Spaniards were attracted to
the capital, far more by the reputation of Livy than by the
splendour of the imperial city.</p>

<p class='c011'>His great work is a history of Rome, which he modestly terms
“<cite class='quote'>Annals</cite>,” in one hundred and forty-two books, preceded by a
brief but elaborately-written preface,<a id='r964' /><a href='#f964' class='c012'><sup>[964]</sup></a> and extending from the
earliest traditions to the death of Drusus.<a id='r965' /><a href='#f965' class='c012'><sup>[965]</sup></a> Of this history
thirty-five books are extant, which were discovered at different
periods.<a id='r966' /><a href='#f966' class='c012'><sup>[966]</sup></a> Of the rest we have only dry and meager epitomes,
drawn up by some uncertain author, and of these two are lost.<a id='r967' /><a href='#f967' class='c012'><sup>[967]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Besides his History, Livy is said<a id='r968' /><a href='#f968' class='c012'><sup>[968]</sup></a> to have written books which
professed to be philosophical, and dialogues, the subjects of which
are partly philosophical, and partly historical. Late in life he
returned to Patavium, and there died <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 18, in the seventy-seventh
year of his age.<a id='r969' /><a href='#f969' class='c012'><sup>[969]</sup></a> He left one son, and one daughter
who married L. Magius, a teacher of rhetoric, of no great talent,
who owed his reputation principally to his connexion with the
historian.<a id='r970' /><a href='#f970' class='c012'><sup>[970]</sup></a> Livy had one great object in view in writing his
History, namely, to celebrate the glories of his native country, to
which he was devotedly attached. He was a patriot: his sympathy
was with Pompey, called forth by the disinterestedness of that
great man, and perhaps by his sad end, after having so long enjoyed
universal popularity. The character of the historian would
lead us to suppose that his attachment was personal rather than political,
for the general spirit of his work shows that he was a man
of pure mind and gentle feelings. He began his great work
about nine or ten years before the Christian era, a period singularly
favourable for such a design. The passages in which especially
he delights to put forth his powers, and on which he dwells
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>with the greatest zest, show the truth of Quintilian’s well-known
criticism, “that he is especially the historian of the affections,
particularly of the softer sensibilities.”<a id='r971' /><a href='#f971' class='c012'><sup>[971]</sup></a> A lost battle
is misery to him; he trembles at the task of relating it. Nor
does he appear to have been a stern republican. He could admire
enthusiastically, and describe with spirit, the noble qualities
and self-devotion which the old republican freedom fostered; but
his object is rather to paint the heroes, and to give graphic representations
of the struggles which they maintained in defence
of liberty, than to show any love of liberty in the abstract, or a
predilection for any particular form of constitution. To Livy
political struggles were no more than subjects for picturesque delineations,
the moral of which was the elevation of national grandeur,
just as successful foreign wars were the records of national
glory. Hence he is a biographer quite as much as an historian:
he anatomizes the moral nature of his heroes, and shows their
inner man, and the motive springs of their noble exploits. This
gives to his narratives the charm of an historical romance, and
makes up for the want of accurate research and political observation.
His characters stand before us objectively, like epic
heroes; and thus he is “the Homer of the Roman people,” whilst
the charm of his narratives makes him the “Herodotus of Roman
historians.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rome was now the mistress of the world: her struggles with
foreign nations had been rewarded with universal dominion; so
that when the Roman empire was spoken of, no title less comprehensive
than “the world” (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">orbis</span></i>) would satisfy the national
vanity. The horrors of civil war had ceased, and were succeeded
by an amnesty of its bitter feuds and bloody animosities.
Liberty indeed had perished, but the people were no longer fit
for the enjoyment of it; and it was exchanged for a mild and paternal
rule, under which all the refinements of civilization were
encouraged, and its subjects could enjoy undisturbed the blessings
of peace and security.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rome, therefore, had rest and breathing-time to look back
into the past—to trace the successive steps by which that marvellous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>edifice, the Roman empire, had been constructed. She
could do this, too, with perfect self-complacency, for there was
no symptom of decay to check her exultation, or to mar the
glories which she was contemplating.</p>

<p class='c011'>Livy, the good, the affectionate, the romantic, was precisely
the popular historian for such times as these. His countrymen
looked naturally for panegyric rather than for criticism. They
were not in a temper to bear one who could remorselessly tear
open and expose to view all the faults and blemishes which
blotted the pages of their history; who could be a morose and
querulous praiser of times gone by, never to return, at the expense
of their present greatness and prosperity. He lived in
happy times, before Rome had learnt by sad experience what
the tyranny of absolutism really was. He tells his story like a
bard singing his lay at a joyous and festive meeting, chequered
by alternate successes and reverses, prosperity and adversity,
but all tending to a happy end at last. These features of his
character, and this object of his work, whilst they constitute his
peculiar charm as a narrator, obviously render him less valuable
as an historian. Although he was not tasteless and spiritless,
like Dionysius, he was not so trustworthy. He would not be
wilfully inaccurate, or otherwise than truth-telling; but if the
legend he was about to tell was captivating and interesting, he
would not stop to inquire whether or not it was true. He would
take upon trust the traditions which had been handed down from
generation to generation without inquiry; and the more flattering
and popular they were, the more suitable would he deem
them for his purpose. Without being himself necessarily superstitious,
he would see that superstitious marvels added to the
embellishments of his story, and, therefore, would accept them
without pronouncing upon their truth or falsehood.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wilful unfairness can never be attributed to Livy: he was
prejudiced, but he was not party-spirited. He loved his country
and his countrymen, and could scarcely persuade himself of the
possibility of their doing wrong. He could scarcely believe
anything derogatory to the national glory. When (to take a
striking example,) in the case of the treaty with Porsena, there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>were two opposite stories, he was led by this partiality to ignore
the well-authenticated fact of the capture of Rome, and to adopt
that account which was most creditable to his countrymen.<a id='r972' /><a href='#f972' class='c012'><sup>[972]</sup></a>
Whenever Rome was false to treaties, unmerciful in victory, or
unsuccessful in arms, he is always anxious to find excuses. His
predilections are evidently aristocratic; and although he states
the facts fairly, he wishes his reader to sympathize with the patricians.</p>

<p class='c011'>The plebeians of the days in which he lived were not the fair
representatives of that enterprising class in the early ages of the
republic, who were as well born as the patricians, although of
different blood; the strength and sinews of the state in its exhausting
wars—dependent only upon them from stern necessity,
because they were ground down to the dust by poverty, and
debt, and oppression, but independently maintaining themselves
by their own industry, gradually acquiring wealth, rising to the
position of a middle class, winning their way perseveringly, step
by step, to political privileges.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lower orders of Rome, in the time of Livy—for the term
plebeian, in its original sense, was no longer applicable—were
debased and degraded; they cared not for liberty or political
power, or self-government; their bosoms throbbed not with sympathy
for the old plebeians, who retired to Mount Sacer, and
shed their blood for their principles. It was difficult, therefore,
for him not to believe that the popular leaders of old times were
unprincipled men, who sought to repair their fortunes by the
arts of the demagogue. In his eyes resistance to tyranny was
treason and rebellion.<a id='r973' /><a href='#f973' class='c012'><sup>[973]</sup></a> But when, as in the story of Virginia,
his gentler affections were enlisted, Livy’s heart warmed with
a generous admiration towards the champions of the people’s
rights, and his political predilections gave way to his sensibilities.
In treating of history almost contemporaneous, Tacitus
confesses his liberality. Although it might have rendered him
more acceptable at the court of his patron if he had vilified his
political foes, yet even imperial favour, acting on the same side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>as political prejudice, did not tempt him to unfairness.<a id='r974' /><a href='#f974' class='c012'><sup>[974]</sup></a> He
could see and acknowledge noble qualities and disinterested
patriotism, and give credit for sincere motives, even to those
who differed in political opinions.</p>

<p class='c011'>From a character such as has been described, much care is
not to be expected as to the sources from which historical information
was derived. Many original documents must have existed
in his day, which he evidently never took the trouble to consult.
A rich treasure of original monuments relating to foreign and
domestic affairs were ready at hand, which might have been
examined without much trouble.<a id='r975' /><a href='#f975' class='c012'><sup>[975]</sup></a> The great Annals of the Pontifex
Maximus were digested into eighty books; and these contained
the names of the magistrates, all memorable events at
home and abroad—even the very days on which they occurred
being marked. The commentaries not only of the priests and
augurs, but of the civil magistrates, were kept with exactness
and regularity. There is no reason for supposing that the <cite>Libri
Lintei</cite><a id='r976' /><a href='#f976' class='c012'><sup>[976]</sup></a> were lost in Livy’s time, although he quotes from Licinius
Macer,<a id='r977' /><a href='#f977' class='c012'><sup>[977]</sup></a> instead of consulting them himself. Three thousand
brazen tablets, on which were engraved acts of the senate and
the plebeians, extending backwards (says Suetonius<a id='r978' /><a href='#f978' class='c012'><sup>[978]</sup></a>) almost to
the building of the city, existed in the Capitol until it was burnt
in the reign of Vespasian. The corpus of civil law, which is
known to have existed in the time of Cicero,<a id='r979' /><a href='#f979' class='c012'><sup>[979]</sup></a> was full of antiquarian
lore; and the twelve tables furnished invaluable information,
not only on language, but on the manners and habits of
bygone times. Nevertheless the fragments of the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leges Regiæ</span></cite>
and the laws of the twelve tables have been more carefully examined
by critics of modern times than they were by Livy, when
they existed in a more perfect condition.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lachmann<a id='r980' /><a href='#f980' class='c012'><sup>[980]</sup></a> has satisfactorily shown that the assertions of Livy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>are not based upon personal investigation, but that he trusted
to the annalists, and took advantage of the researches of preceding
historians. This is all that he himself professes to do;
and even these professions he does not always satisfactorily perform.
He does not appear to have profited by the Annals of
Varro or the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Origines</span></cite> of Cato, a work which, according to the
testimony of Cicero, must have been invaluable to an historian;
and although the Archæologia of Dionysius were published
about the time at which Livy commenced his history,<a id='r981' /><a href='#f981' class='c012'><sup>[981]</sup></a> there is
no evidence that he makes use of it; certainly he never acknowledges
any obligation to the indefatigable researches of the
Greek historian. According to his own confession,<a id='r982' /><a href='#f982' class='c012'><sup>[982]</sup></a> Roman history
is total darkness until the capture of Rome by the Gauls;
and although a dim light then begins to break, a twilight period
succeeds, which continues until the first Punic war. But it cannot
be asserted that he prepared himself for his difficult task as
he ought, or took advantage of all the means at his disposal to
enlighten the obscurity in which his subject was involved. The
authorities on which he principally depends for the contents of
the first Decade were such as Ennius, Fab. Pictor, Cincius, and
Piso. It is evident that he also consulted Greek writers. In
the third, which contains the most beautiful and elaborate passages
of the whole work, he follows Polybius. Nor could he,
in this portion of his history, follow a safer one. The Romans,
notwithstanding all their practical tendencies, did little to promote
geographical science. It is amongst the Greeks that we
find the most accurate and indefatigable geographers, such as
were Polybius, Strabo, and Ptolemy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Polybius prepared himself for the task of narrating the Italian
campaign of Hannibal by personal inspection. Livy did nothing
of the kind. The former travelled through the Alpine passes;
and his authority was considered so good that Strabo implicitly
followed him. It is to be lamented that, as he was writing to
his countrymen, he seldom mentions the name of places; probably
he thought they would not be the wiser for the enumeration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>of unknown barbarian names. But his accuracy in dates and
distances enables us to trace Hannibal’s route with correctness.
These prove that the passage of Hannibal was by the Alpis
Graia, the Little St. Bernard; a statement which had been made
by that veracious<a id='r983' /><a href='#f983' class='c012'><sup>[983]</sup></a> historian, Cælius Antipater, and also by Cornelius
Nepos.<a id='r984' /><a href='#f984' class='c012'><sup>[984]</sup></a> It has been since confirmed by the researches of
modern travellers, such as General Melville, M. de Luc, Cramer,
and Wickham. Strange to say, Livy, although following the
route marked out by Polybius almost step by step, at length ends
it with the Alpis Cottia (M. Genevre.) The absence of names
left the fireside traveller at fault. Cæsar<a id='r985' /><a href='#f985' class='c012'><sup>[985]</sup></a> had crossed the Alps
by that pass; and, perhaps, Livy named it at a venture, as the
most familiar to him. In the succeeding portions of his work,
so complete is the confidence which he reposes upon the guidance
of Polybius, that the fourth and fifth Decades are little
more than the history of Polybius paraphrased.</p>

<p class='c011'>Niebuhr,<a id='r986' /><a href='#f986' class='c012'><sup>[986]</sup></a> from internal evidence, gives an interesting account
of the manner in which it is probable that Livy wrote his history.
He supposes that, like most of the ancients, he employed a secretary,
who read to him from existing authorities the events of
a single year. These the historian mentally arranged, and then
dictated his own narrative. The work, therefore, was composed
in portions; the connexion of the events of one year with those
of the preceding one was lost sight of, and thus they seem isolated;
and the conclusion of a series of events sometimes unaccountably
synchronizes with the conclusion of a year.</p>

<p class='c011'>To his deficiencies in the habit of diligent and accurate investigation
are added others which singularly disqualify him for the
task of a faithful historian. He was a reader of books rather
than a student of men and things; he took upon trust what other
people told him, instead of acquiring knowledge in a practical
manner.  He was ill-acquainted with the history of foreign
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>countries. He was not, like Cæsar, a soldier; and therefore his
descriptions of military affairs are often vague and indistinct, for
he did not understand the tactics which he professed to describe.
He was not, like Thucydides, a politician or a philosopher; and
hence the little trustworthy information which we derive from
him on questions connected with constitutional changes. He did
not fit himself, like Herodotus, by travelling; and thus he is
often ignorant of the localities which he describes, even though
they are within the limits of Italy. Hence the difficulties in the
way of understanding the route of Hannibal and his army across
the Alps, the battle of Thrasimene, and the defeat at the Caudine
Forks. He was not a philosopher, a lawyer, or a politician: he
could embrace with the eye and depict with the hand of an artist
everything which was external and tangible; but he could not
penetrate the secret motives which actuate the human will, nor
form a clear conception of the fundamental, legal and political
principles which animated the institutions, and gave rise to the
peculiarities, of Roman constitutional history.</p>

<p class='c011'>With respect to the speeches which he attributes to his principal
heroes, a greater degree of accuracy cannot be expected, than is
found in those of Thucydides. But they do not possess that
verisimilitude which is so admirable in those of the Greek historian.
As works of art they are faultless, but Livy does not keep
in view the principle adhered to by Thucydides, that they should
be such as the speakers were likely to have delivered on the
occasions in question. His great authority, Polybius, disapproves
of imaginary speeches altogether;<a id='r987' /><a href='#f987' class='c012'><sup>[987]</sup></a> but it must be remembered
that, without some oratorical display, he would not have pleased
the Roman people. The speeches of Thucydides, although they
bear the stamp of the writer’s mind, are, to a certain extent,
characteristic of the speaker, and seem inspired by the occasion.
If a Spartan speaks, he is laconic; if a general, he is soldier-like;
if a statesman or demagogue, he is logical or argumentative, or
appeals to the feelings and passions of the Athenian people.
Consistency produces variety. The speeches of Livy are pleasing
and eloquent,<a id='r988' /><a href='#f988' class='c012'><sup>[988]</sup></a> but they are always, so to speak, Livian; they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>frequently not such as Romans would have spoken in times when
eloquence was rude, though forcible. They partake of the rhetorical
and declamatory spirit, which was already beginning to
creep over Roman literature; and often, from being unsuitable
to time, place, and person, diminish, instead of heightening, the
dramatic effect.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such are the principal defects which cause us to regret that,
whilst Livy charms us with his romantic narratives and almost
faultless style, he is too often a fallacious guide as an historian,
and gives, not intentionally or dishonestly, but from the character
of his mind, and the object which he proposed to himself, a false
colouring or a vague and inaccurate outline to the events which
he narrates. No one can avoid relishing the liveliness, freshness,
and “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">lactea ubertas</span>,” of Livy’s fascinating style; but its principal
excellence is summed up in the expression of Quintilian, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">clarissimus
candor</span></i>,” (brightness and lucidity.<a id='r989' /><a href='#f989' class='c012'><sup>[989]</sup></a>) On the authority of
Asinius Pollio, quoted by the same writer,<a id='r990' /><a href='#f990' class='c012'><sup>[990]</sup></a> a certain fault has
been attributed to him, termed “Patavinity,” <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>, some peculiar
ideas not admissible in the purest Latin, which mark the place
of his nativity. So little pains do people take in the investigation
of truth, and so ready are they to take upon trust what their
predecessors have believed before them, that generation after
generation have assumed that Livy’s clear, eloquent, and transparent
style is disfigured by what we term provincialisms.<a id='r991' /><a href='#f991' class='c012'><sup>[991]</sup></a> The
penetrating mind of Niebuhr finds no ground for believing the
story. If there is any truth in it, he supposes the criticism must
have applied to his speaking, and not to his writing.<a id='r992' /><a href='#f992' class='c012'><sup>[992]</sup></a> His style
is always classical, even in the later decades: though prolix and
tautologous, it is invariably marked by idiomatic purity and
grammatical accuracy.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Grammarians.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The grammarians may be passed over with little more notice
than the simple mention of their names, because, although they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>contributed to the stock of their country’s literature, they added
little or nothing to its literary reputation. The most conspicuous
amongst them were—Atteius Philologus, a freedman and friend
of Sallust; Staberius Eros, who taught Brutus and Cassius; Q.
Cæcilius Epirota, the correspondent of Cicero; C. Julius Hyginus,
a Spaniard, the friend of Ovid, and curator of the Palatine library;
Verrius Flaccus, the tutor to the grandsons of Augustus; Q. Cornificius,
who was augur at the same time with Cicero; and P.
Nigidius Figulus, an orator and philosopher as well as a grammarian.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>M. Vitruvius Pollio.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The distinguished name of M. Vitruvius Pollio claims a place
in a catalogue of the Augustan writers. His subject, indeed,
belongs to the apartment of the fine arts; but his varied acquirements
and extensive knowledge, as well as the manner in which,
notwithstanding some faults, he treats his subject, shed some
lustre upon Roman literature, and stamp him as one of the didactic
writers of his country.</p>

<p class='c011'>Little information exists respecting this celebrated architect;
and this circumstance has led to his being confounded with another
professor of the same art, L. Vitruvius Cerdo. The name of the
latter is thus inscribed on an arch, which was his work, at Verona:<a id='r993' /><a href='#f993' class='c012'><sup>[993]</sup></a>
“<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Q. Vitruvius L. L. Cerdo, Architectus</span></cite>.” That Cerdo was not
the author of the treatise extant under the name of Vitruvius,
may be satisfactorily proved:—Firstly. The letters L. L. signify
that he was Lucii Libertus (the freedman of Lucius,) whereas M.
Vitruvius Pollio was born free. Secondly. The arch on which
the name appears belongs to an age when the Romans had begun,
in defiance of the precepts of Pollio, to neglect the principles of
Greek architecture.<a id='r994' /><a href='#f994' class='c012'><sup>[994]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Both the place and date of his birth are unknown. According
to some authorities he was born at Verona; according to others
at Formiæ;<a id='r995' /><a href='#f995' class='c012'><sup>[995]</sup></a> but he himself asserts that he received a good liberal
education; and the truth of this statement is confirmed by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>knowledge which he displays of Greek and Roman literature,
and his acquaintance with works which treat, not only of architecture,
but also of polite learning and even philosophy<a id='r996' /><a href='#f996' class='c012'><sup>[996]</sup></a>—the
writings, for example, of Lucretius, Cicero, and Varro. But the
great object of his studies was, undoubtedly, professional, and to
this he made literature a handmaid.</p>

<p class='c011'>Vitruvius served under Julius Cæsar in Africa as a military
engineer; and was subsequently employed by one of the emperors,
to whom his treatise is dedicated, in the direction and
control of that department of the public service. By his favour,
and the kindness of his sister, he was thus placed in a condition,
if not of affluence, at least of competency. Who his imperial
patron was has been disputed; but the widely extended conquests,
the augmentation of the empire, the political institutions,
and, moreover, the taste for architecture which Vitruvius attributes
to him, renders it most probable that it was Augustus, the
sovereign who found the city of bricks and left it of marble. It
is clear that his work was written after the death of Julius
Cæsar, and not later than that of Titus, for the former he prefixes
the word Divus, whilst he does not mention the Coliseum;
and, although he speaks of Vesuvius,<a id='r997' /><a href='#f997' class='c012'><sup>[997]</sup></a> he is evidently not aware
of any eruptions having taken place except in ancient times.
Notwithstanding the arguments adduced by W. Newton<a id='r998' /><a href='#f998' class='c012'><sup>[998]</sup></a> to prove
that he wrote in the reign of Titus, it is now universally admitted
that Vitruvius was a writer of the Augustan age. The inferiority
of his style to that of his contemporaries, its occasional obscurity
and want of method, the not unfrequent occurrence of inelegant,
and even barbarous expressions, notwithstanding his classical
education, may be accounted for by what has already been stated
respecting the professional object of all his studies. He himself
claims indulgence on this score,<a id='r999' /><a href='#f999' class='c012'><sup>[999]</sup></a> and states that he writes as an
architect, and not as a literary man. So much of its difficulty as
arises from conciseness he considers a matter for boasting rather
than apology.</p>

<p class='c011'>In forming an estimate of the Latinity of an author like Vitruvius,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>it must not be forgotten that our taste is formed by
authority and by a study of the best models. Novelty is exceptional,
and therefore displeases. But technical subjects render
not only the introduction of new terms necessary, but even, owing
to the poverty of language, awkward periphrases and obscure
phraseology. Nevertheless, upon the whole, the language of
Vitruvius is vigorous, his descriptions bold, and seem the work
of a true and correct hand, and a practised draughtsman.</p>

<p class='c011'>His work consists of ten books, in which he treats of the whole
subject in a systematic and orderly manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>The following are its principal contents:—A general view of
the science and of the education suitable to an architect; the
choice of sites; the arrangement of the buildings and fortifications
of a city;<a id='r1000' /><a href='#f1000' class='c012'><sup>[1000]</sup></a> an interesting essay on the earliest human dwellings,
building materials,<a id='r1001' /><a href='#f1001' class='c012'><sup>[1001]</sup></a> temples, altars,<a id='r1002' /><a href='#f1002' class='c012'><sup>[1002]</sup></a> forums, basilicæ, treasuries,
jails, court-houses, baths, palæstræ, harbours, theatres, together
with their acoustic principles, and the theory of musical sounds
and harmonies.<a id='r1003' /><a href='#f1003' class='c012'><sup>[1003]</sup></a> Private dwellings, both in town and country;<a id='r1004' /><a href='#f1004' class='c012'><sup>[1004]</sup></a>

<p class='c011'>His work is valuable as a conspectus of the principles of Greek
architectural taste and beauty, of which he was a devoted admirer,
and from which he would not willingly have permitted any deviation.
But he was evidently deficient in the knowledge of
the principles of Greek architectural construction.<a id='r1009' /><a href='#f1009' class='c012'><sup>[1009]</sup></a> His taste
was pure, too pure probably for the Romans; for, notwithstanding
his theoretical excellence, we have no evidence of his being employed,
practically, as an architect, except in the case of the
Basilica,<a id='r1010' /><a href='#f1010' class='c012'><sup>[1010]</sup></a> at Colonia Julia Fanestris, now Fano, near Ancona.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <span class='small'>DECLINE OF ROMAN LITERATURE—IT BECAME DECLAMATORY—BIOGRAPHY OF PHÆDRUS—GENUINENESS OF HIS FABLES—MORAL AND POLITICAL LESSONS INCULCATED IN THEM—SPECIMENS OF FABLES—FABLES SUGGESTED BY HISTORICAL EVENTS—SEJANUS AND TIBERIUS—EPOCH UNFAVOURABLE TO LITERATURE—INGENUITY OF PHÆDRUS—SUPERIORITY OF ÆSOP—THE STYLE OF PHÆDRUS CLASSICAL.</span></h3>

<p class='c010'>With the death of Augustus<a id='r1011' /><a href='#f1011' class='c012'><sup>[1011]</sup></a> commenced the decline of Roman
literature, and only three illustrious names, Phædrus, Persius,
and Lucan, rescue the first years of this period from the
charge of a corrupt and vitiated taste. After awhile, indeed,
political circumstances again became more favourable—the dangers
which paralyzed genius and talent, and prevented their
free exercise under Tiberius and his tyrannical successors, diminished,
and a more liberal system of administration ensued
under Vespasian and Titus. Juvenal and Tacitus then stood
forth as the representatives of the old Roman independence;
vigour of thought communicated itself to the language; a taste
for the sublime and beautiful to a certain extent revived,
although it did not attain to the perfection which shed a lustre
over the Augustan age.</p>

<p class='c011'>The characteristic of the first literature of this epoch was
declamation and rhetoric. As liberty declined, true natural
eloquence gradually decayed. When it is no longer necessary
or even possible to persuade or convince the people, that eloquence
which calms the passions, wins the affections, or appeals
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>to common sense and the reasoning powers, has no opportunity
for exercise. Its object is a new one—namely, to please and
attract an audience who listen in a mere critical spirit: the
weapons which it makes use of are novelty and ingenuity;
novelty soon becomes strangeness, and strangeness exaggeration;
whilst ingenuity implies unnatural study and a display of
pedantic erudition—the aiming at startling and striking effects—and
at length ends in affectation.</p>

<p class='c011'>If this was the prevailing false taste under the immediate
successors of Augustus, it is not surprising that it affected poetry
as well as prose; and that the principal talent of the poet lay
in florid and diffuse descriptions, whilst his chief fault was a
style overladen with ornament. The tragedies ascribed to Seneca
are theatrical declamations; the satires of Persius are philosophical
declamations; whilst the poems of Lucan and Silius
Italicus, though epic in form, are nothing more than descriptive
poems, and their style is rather rhetorical than poetical.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Phædrus.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Fable had been long known and popular amongst the Romans
before the time of Phædrus. Livy could not have attributed
the well-known one to Menenius Agrippa, unless it had been a
familiar tradition of long standing. Fables amused the guests of
Horace, and furnished subjects to those of Ovid. In this, as in
other fields of literature, Rome was an imitator of Greece; but
nevertheless the Roman fabulist struck out a new line for himself,
and in his hands fable became, not only a moral instructor,
but a severe political satirist. Phædrus, the originator and
only author of Roman fable, flourished on the common confines
of the golden and the silver age. His mode of thought, as well
as the events which suggested both his original illustrations and
his adaptations of the Æsopean stories, belong to that epoch of
transition. His works are, as it were, isolated: he has no contemporaries.
Although he was born in the reign of Augustus,
he wrote when the Augustan age had passed away. Nevertheless
his solitary voice was lifted up when those of the poet, the
historian, and the philosopher were silenced.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>Phædrus, like Horace, is his own biographer; and the only
knowledge which we have respecting his life is furnished by his
Fables. In the prologue to the third book he informs us that he
was a native of Thrace: “I,” he says, “to whom my mother
gave birth on the Pierian hill—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ego quem Pierio mater enixa est jugo.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>And, again, he exclaims, “Why should I, who am nearer to
lettered Greece, desert for slothful indolence the honour of my
fatherland, when Thrace can reckon up her poets, and Apollo
is the parent of Linus, the muse of Orpheus, who by his song
endowed rocks with motion, tamed the wild beasts, and stopped
the rapid Hebrus with welcome delay?—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ego literatæ qui sum propior Græciæ,</div>

      <div class='line'>Hebrique tenuit impetus dulci morâ?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c022'>From the title, “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Augusti Libertus</span></cite>,” prefixed to his fables, it is
clear that he adds one more distinguished name to that list of
freedmen, who were celebrated in the annals of literature. Although,
in the preface to his work, he modestly terms himself
only a translator of Æsop,</p>

<div class='c016'>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c022'>still, for many of his fables, he deserves the credit of originality.
Probably he enlarged and extended his original plan; for he
afterwards speaks of simply adopting the style and not the matter
of the Æsopean fable.<a id='r1013' /><a href='#f1013' class='c012'><sup>[1013]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>He does not appear to have gained much fame or popularity;
for he is only twice mentioned by ancient authorities, namely,
by Martial<a id='r1014' /><a href='#f1014' class='c012'><sup>[1014]</sup></a> and Seneca.<a id='r1015' /><a href='#f1015' class='c012'><sup>[1015]</sup></a> The latter, writing to Polybius, a favourite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>freedman of Claudius, encourages him to enter upon the
field which Phædrus already occupied, asserting that fables in
the style of Æsop constituted a work hitherto unattempted by
Roman genius (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">intentatum Romanis ingeniis opus</span></i>.) Either,
therefore, the fables of Phædrus were little known and appreciated,
or Seneca purposely concealed from the Emperor’s favourite
the fact of their existence, in order to flatter him with
the hopes of his thus becoming the first Roman writer in his
style. The persecution to which literary men were subject under
the worst Emperors, of which Phædrus hints obscurely that he
was a victim<a id='r1016' /><a href='#f1016' class='c012'><sup>[1016]</sup></a>—the perils to which he would have been exposed
by strictures upon persons in power, which, concealed under the
veil of fiction, appear now dark and enigmatical, but which might
have spoken plainly to the consciences of the actors themselves—probably
rendered it a wise precaution to conceal his works
during his lifetime; hence they would be little known, except to
a chosen few, and the few copies made of them would account
for the rarity of the extant manuscripts.</p>

<p class='c011'>Owing to the deficiency of ancient testimony, the genuineness
of the Fables has been disputed; but the purity of style, and the
natural allusions to contemporary events render it almost certain
that they belong to the age in which they were supposed to have
been written. No one but a contemporary could have written
the fable commencing—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c022'>The prologue to the third book evidently speaks of the author’s
own calamities; and the way in which the name of Sejanus is
connected with the event, hints, although obscurely, that that
prime minister of tyranny was the author of his sufferings. It
is scarcely probable that he would have ventured to attack Sejanus
during his lifetime. It may, therefore, be assumed that
Phædrus lived beyond the eighteenth year of the reign of Tiberius,
in which year Sejanus died.</p>

<p class='c011'>The original manuscript followed in the early editions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>Phædrus was discovered in the tenth century: it contained ninety-seven
fables, divided into five books. But N. Perotto, an archbishop
of Manfredonia, in the fifteenth century, published a
miscellaneous collection of Latin fables, and amongst them were
thirty-two new fables attributed to Phædrus, which were not
found in the older editions. These were at first supposed to
have been written by Perotto himself; but the manifest inferiority
of some poems known to be the work of the archbishop, and
the Augustan purity of style which marks the newly-discovered
fables, leave little doubt of their genuineness. Consequently,
they were published by Angelo Mai as supplementary to those
which had already appeared.</p>

<p class='c011'>The circumstances of the times in which he lived suggested
the moral and prudential lessons which his fables inculcated.
The bane of Rome, under the empire, was the public informer
(<i>delator</i>,) as the sycophant had been the pest of Athens. Life
and conduct, private as well as public, were exposed to a complete
system of espionage: no one was safe from this formidable
inquisition; a man’s familiar associate might be in secret his
bitterest enemy. But the principal victims were the rich: they
were marked out for destruction, in order that the confiscation of
their property might glut the avarice of the Emperor and the
informers. For this reason, Phædrus himself professes always
to have seen the peril of acquiring wealth—</p>

<p class='c022'>And we cannot be surprised that the danger of riches, and the
comparative safety of obscurity and poverty, should sometimes
form the moral of his fables.</p>

<p class='c011'>That of the Mules and the Thieves, which is entirely his own,

<p class='c011'>“Two mules, laden with heavy burdens, were journeying together:
one carried bags of money; the other, sacks filled with
barley. The former, proud of his rich load, carried his head
high, and made the bell on his neck sound merrily; his companion
followed with quiet and gentle paces. On a sudden, some
thieves rush from an ambuscade, wound the treasure-mule, strip
him of his money-bags, but leave untouched the worthless barley.
When, therefore, the sufferer bewailed his sad case—‘For
my part,’ replied his companion, ‘I rejoice that I was
treated with contempt; for I have no wounds, and have lost
nothing.’ The subject of this fable proves that poverty is safe,
whilst great wealth is exposed to peril.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The fable of the Man and the Ass teaches a salutary lesson
to another class of wealthy men, namely, those favourites of
the emperor and his creatures, who owed their wealth to plunder
and confiscation. Every day’s experience proved that those
who battened on the spoils of the oppressed one day, became
themselves the victims of the same tyrannical system the next.
Like that of the prime minister, Sejanus himself, the sun of
their prosperity was destined to set, and their ill-gotten spoil
to enrich others as unworthy as themselves. Those fortunes
were indeed built upon a rotten foundation, which the same system
had power to raise up and to overthrow:—</p>

<p class='c011'>“In a change of princes the poor change nothing but the name

little fable. A timid old man was feeding his ass in a meadow.
Alarmed by the shouts of an advancing enemy he urged the ass
to fly for fear they should be taken prisoners. But the ass loitered,
and said, ‘Pray, do you think that the conqueror will put
two pack-saddles on my back?’ ‘No,’ replied the old man.

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>The well known fable of the Wolf and the Lamb (i. 1) illustrates
the unscrupulousness of the informers; and that of the
Wolf and the House-dog (iii. 7) teaches how preferable is
liberty, even under the greatest privations, to luxury and comfort
purchased by submission to the caprices of a master.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of such a kind were the moral and political lessons which
Phædrus enforced in the attractive garb of fables. They were
of a general character, suggested by the evils of the times in
which he lived.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another class were suggested by historical events: they were
nevertheless severe satirical strictures on individuals. Two
may be pointed out as examples which are evidently directed
against Tiberius and Sejanus. These are—The Frogs demanding
a King, (i. 2;) and the Frogs and the Sun, (i. 6.) Neither
of the fables are original; they are apposite applications of two
by Æsop.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Romans,<a id='r1021' /><a href='#f1021' class='c012'><sup>[1021]</sup></a> like the frogs in the first of these fables, had
exchanged their liberty for the slavery of the empire. In Tiberius,
now an imbecile dotard, wholly given up to sensual indulgence
in his retreat at Capreæ, they had a perfect King Log.
He was utterly careless of the sufferings of his subjects and the
administration of his kingdom.</p>

<p class='c011'>To his odious minister, Sejanus, he intrusted the toils of government,
to which his own indolence indisposed him.  All
tyranny and cruelty were ascribed to the ministers; whilst the
effeminate debauchery of the Emperor rendered him, even in that
demoralized age, an object of contempt and insult rather than of
abhorrence and fear. L. Sejanus, a kinsman of Ælius,<a id='r1022' /><a href='#f1022' class='c012'><sup>[1022]</sup></a> employed
bald-headed persons, and children with their heads shaved, in
the procession of the Floral games, in order to hold up to scorn
and derision the bald-headed Emperor, and he dared not take
notice of the insult. The infamous Fulcinius Trio in his last
will declared that Tiberius had become childish in his old age,
and that his continued retirement was nothing else but exile.<a id='r1023' /><a href='#f1023' class='c012'><sup>[1023]</sup></a>
Pacuvianus was the author of pasquinades against the Emperor.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>In the same way Phædrus describes the frogs as treating “King
Log” with scorn, and as defiling him in the most offensive manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>But after the death of Sejanus a change took place in the
Emperor’s conduct, though not in his character. He left Capreæ
for a time, and took up his abode in the Vatican, close to the
very walls of Rome. He now gave vent to his savage disposition,
and displayed the temper of the water-snake in the fable. His
natural cruelty was equalled by his activity. “His sharp tooth
seized his unresisting victims one after the other: in vain they
fly from death; fear prevents them from uttering a word in
defence or expostulation.” No longer a vast expanse of sea and
land intervened between the tyrant and his victims. There was
nothing to delay the pompous and verbose missives of his bloody
purposes: his rescripts could reach the consuls the same day, or
at least after the interval of a night: he could behold, as it were,
with his own eyes, the reeking hands of the executioners, and the
waves of blood which deluged every dwelling.<a id='r1024' /><a href='#f1024' class='c012'><sup>[1024]</sup></a> Vengeance not
only fell on the guilty Sejanus and his unoffending family, the
vilest and the noblest blood of Rome alike flowed at the tyrant’s
command. The fable of the Frogs and the Sun was a covert
attack upon the ambitious designs of Sejanus. It is sufficiently
short to be quoted:</p>

<div class='c016'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>“Once upon a time the Sun determined to marry; and the
Frogs raised a cry of alarm to Heaven. Jupiter, moved by their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>complaints, asked the cause of them. One of the denizens of
the pond answered:—‘Now the Sun by himself dries up all the
lakes, and causes us to die a miserable death in our parched-up
dwellings. What then will become of us if he has children?’”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now let us examine the application. The fawning yet ambitious
Sejanus had always aspired to ally himself with the imperial
family. The first attempt which he made to accomplish his design
was procuring the betrothal of his daughter to Drusus, the
son of Claudius, afterwards emperor. This prince died young,
and consequently the marriage never took place;<a id='r1026' /><a href='#f1026' class='c012'><sup>[1026]</sup></a> but this first
opened the eyes of the Romans to the audacious projects of the
favourite. Later in his career,<a id='r1027' /><a href='#f1027' class='c012'><sup>[1027]</sup></a> he, by a similar step, endeavoured
to pave his way to the imperial purple. He seduced
Livilla, the sister of the amiable Germanicus, poisoned her husband,
divorced his own wife, and asked the sanction of Tiberius
to his marriage with the widow of the murdered man. The
emperor, with his usual finesse and dissimulation, refused. The
demand awoke the suspicions of the court, and was a commencement
of that coolness between Sejanus and his patron which
eventually ended in the fall of the latter. The influence of
Sejanus alone was sufficiently baneful; what would it be if multiplied
by a race of princes descended from him? The mere
probability of such an event naturally filled Rome with alarm
and consternation; and this Phædrus endeavoured to encourage
by a fable, which, if it had not some such object as this, would
scarcely be intelligible.</p>

<p class='c011'>The quotations which have been given from the fables of
Phædrus are sufficient, as examples of his ingenuity in imitation
and adaptation, as well as of his original genius, whenever he
trusts to his powers of invention. Some of his pieces, although,
like the rest, they are entitled fables, are, in fact, narratives of
real events, and show that he possessed a charming talent for
telling anecdotes, besides skill as a fabulist in the proper sense
of the term. His style has great merits: it combines the simple
neatness and graceful elegance of the golden age with the vigour
and terseness of the silver one. Phædrus has the facility of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>Ovid, and the brevity of Tacitus. Thus standing in the epoch
between two literary periods, he, as far as the humble nature
of his walk admits, unites the excellencies of both. Between
the age of Horace and Juvenal, Cicero and Tacitus, there was a
gap, and a long one, not less than half a century: it was a period
in which Roman genius was slumbering. Phædrus proves that
that sleep was not the sleep of death. Tacitus has partially
accounted for this cold and dark interval. He tells us<a id='r1028' /><a href='#f1028' class='c012'><sup>[1028]</sup></a>—“that
although the affairs of the ancient Roman republic, whether in
prosperity or in adversity, were related by illustrious writers—and
even the times of Augustus were not deficient in historians
of talent and genius—nevertheless the gradual growth of a spirit
of adulation deterred all who were qualified for the task from
attempting it. Fear, during the lifetime of Tiberius, Caius,
Claudius, and Nero, and hatred, still fresh after their deaths,
rendered all accounts of their reigns false.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was thus, according to him, fear and hatred, and a spirit of
flattery, that silenced the voice of history. Doubtless what he
says of history applies with equal force to poetry, and oratory
likewise. The same cause which crushed political liberty rendered
the truthfulness of the historian fraught with danger, and
all poetry, except it spoke the language of adulation, treason;
a crime which was no longer one against the majesty of the
people, but was transferred to the person of the emperor. The
very term <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παρρησια</span> (boldness of speech) was a word, the utterance
of which was as perilous as to speak of liberty.<a id='r1029' /><a href='#f1029' class='c012'><sup>[1029]</sup></a> The danger
had scarcely passed away when Juvenal, notwithstanding his
fearless spirit, wrote:—</p>

</div>

</div>
<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>But there was a negative as well as a positive cause, the withdrawal
of patronage. Literature, in order to flourish, requires
the genial sunshine of human sympathy: it needs either the patronage
of the great or the favour of the people. In Greece it
enjoyed the latter in the highest possible degree; in Rome, from
the time of the Scipios to that of Augustus, it was fostered by
the former. Immediately after his death patronage was withdrawn,
and there was not public support to supply its place.
Tiberius was first a soldier; then a dark and reserved politician;
lastly, a blood-thirsty and superstitious sensualist. The enjoyments
of Gaius Caligula were the extravagancies of a madman,
although he was responsible for his moral insanity, because he
had, by vicious indulgence, been the destroyer of his moral principle;
and not only did he not encourage literature, but he even
hated Homer and Virgil. Lastly, the stupid and dozing Claudius
wrote books<a id='r1030' /><a href='#f1030' class='c012'><sup>[1030]</sup></a> as stupid as himself, and was at once the butt and
tool of his courtiers. It was not, therefore, until the reign of
Nero that literature revived; for, though the bloodiest of tyrants,
he had an ambition to excel in refinement, and had a taste for
art and poetry.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the construction of his fables, Phædrus displays observation
and ingenuity. Nothing escapes his watchful eye which
can be turned to account in his little poems. A rude sketch in
charcoal on the wall of a low tavern<a id='r1031' /><a href='#f1031' class='c012'><sup>[1031]</sup></a> suggested to him the idea
of the Battle between the Rats and the Weasels. His animals
are grouped, and put in attitudes, just as a painter would arrange
them. His accurate eye has noted and registered the habits of
the brute creation, and he has adapted them to the delivery of
noble and wise sentiments with the utmost ingenuity. But there
his genius stops. He is deficient in imagination. He makes his
animals the vehicles of his wisdom; but he does not throw himself
into them, or identify himself with them. The true poet is
lost in his characters: carried away by the enthusiasm of an inspired
imagination, his spirit is transfused into his heroes;—you
forget his existence. The characters of Phædrus look and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>act like animals, but talk like human beings: the moralist and the
philosopher can always be detected speaking under their mask
and in their disguise.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this consists the great superiority of Æsop to his Roman
imitator. His brutes are a superior race, but they are still
brutes. The reader could almost fancy that the fabulist had
lived amongst them as one of themselves—had adopted their
modes of life, and had conversed with them in their own language.
In Phædrus we have human sentiments translated into
the language of beasts—in Æsop we have beasts giving utterance
to such sentiments as would be naturally theirs, if they
were placed in the position of men. Skilful adaptation and
happy delineation are the triumphs of ingenuity and observation:
the creative power is that of the imagination.</p>

<p class='c011'>The style of Phædrus, notwithstanding a few provincialisms,<a id='r1032' /><a href='#f1032' class='c012'><sup>[1032]</sup></a>
is pure and classical. He does not often indulge in the use of
metaphors, but the few which are met with are striking and appropriate.
He is not entirely free from some of that far-fetched
affectation which characterizes the decline of Roman literature.
But his fault is exaggerated conciseness, and the concentration
of many ideas within a brief space, rather than the rhetorical
ornament which now began to be admired and popular. His
endeavour after brevity led him to use abstract substantives far
more profusely than is consistent with the practice of the best
classical writers. These faults, however, do not interfere with
that clearness and simplicity, which, quite as much as the subjects,
have rendered the fables of Phædrus a popular book for
the young student, and please even those who have the opportunity
of comparing his iambics with the liveliness of Gay, the
politeness of Florian, the philosophy of Lessing, the sweetness
of Cowper, and the unequalled versatility of La Fontaine.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of Roman tragedy in its earliest period, so far as the fragments
of it which remain allow a judgment to be formed, an account
has already been given; and if circumstances forbade it to flourish
then, still less can it be expected that the boldness and independence
of Greek tragedy would be found under the empire.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nevertheless, there were not wanting some imitators of Greece
in this noblest branch of Greek poetry, however unsuitable it
was to the genius of the Roman people, and unlikely to be appreciated
by them.</p>

<p class='c011'>But their productions were rather literary than dramatic;
they were intended to be read, not acted. They were poems
composed in a dramatic form, because Athens had set the example
of that form to her devoted imitators. Although, therefore,
they contain noble philosophical sentiments, lively descriptions,
vigorous conceptions and delineations of character, and passages
full of tenderness and pathos, they are deficient in dramatic
effect, and positively offend against those laws of good taste,
which, not arbitrarily assumed, but founded on the principles
of the human mind, regulated the Athenian stage.</p>

<p class='c011'>We have seen that, in the Augustan age, a few writers attained
some excellence in tragedy, at least in the opinion of ancient
critics. Besides Ovid and Varius, whose tragedies have been
already mentioned, Asinius Pollio acquired a high reputation as
a tragic poet, and Virgil<a id='r1033' /><a href='#f1033' class='c012'><sup>[1033]</sup></a> declares that he is the only one worthy
of being compared with Sophocles:—</p>

<p class='c011'>On the revival of letters under that professor of a love of
poetry,<a id='r1034' /><a href='#f1034' class='c012'><sup>[1034]</sup></a> the tyrant Nero, dramatic literature reappeared, and perfect
specimens are extant in the ten tragedies attributed to Seneca.
Various and opposite opinions have been entertained respecting
their merits; but there can be no doubt that the genius of the
author never can grasp in their wholeness the characters which
he attempts to copy; they are distorted images of the Greek
originals; the awful and shadowy grandeur of the god-like heroes
of Æschylus stand forth in corporeal vastness, and appear
childish and unnatural, like the giants of a story-book. The
marvels of Greek tragedy and Greek mythology, though merely
the unreal conceptions of the imagination, do not appear exaggerated,
because the connexion between the theory and the result,
the causes and the effects, is so skilfully maintained; but in these
Roman tragedies the legends of Greece appear extravagant and
absurd: they are as unreal, and therefore seem as affected, as
the classical garb in which English poetry was arrayed in the
age of Anne. The Greeks believed in the gods and heroes whose
agency and exploits constituted the machinery of tragedy—the
Romans did not; and thus we cannot sympathize with them,
because we see that they are insincere. The style, moreover,
of the tragedies, which bear the name of Seneca, is spoiled by
that inflated language and redundancy of ornament, the constant
effect of which is, as Aristotle observes, frigidity. They bear
the visible marks of an age in which genius had given place to
an artificial and scholastic rhetoric; and the author seems to have
been striving not for tragic pathos so much as brilliant declamation.
In the female characters, especially, the Roman tragic
poet fails; for, although he can understand heroism, he is unable
to accomplish that most difficult of all tasks, the combining it with
feminine delicacy. Perhaps the best and noblest of his country-women
did not furnish him with such ideals. The Roman matron
was the counterpart of her warlike lord. The Lucretias, Porcias,
Cornelias, Arrias, though devoted and affectionate, were of sterner
mould than Antigone and Deianira.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>The tragedies which bear the name of Seneca have been attributed
to L. Annæus Seneca, the philosopher, as early as the
time of Quintilian,<a id='r1035' /><a href='#f1035' class='c012'><sup>[1035]</sup></a> who quotes as Seneca’s a verse from the
Medea. The improbability of this being the case is also diminished
by the fact that both Tacitus<a id='r1036' /><a href='#f1036' class='c012'><sup>[1036]</sup></a> and Pliny the younger<a id='r1037' /><a href='#f1037' class='c012'><sup>[1037]</sup></a>

considered a very doubtful question. A passage in an epigram
of Martial, in which he speaks of Cordova as the birthplace of
two Senecas and one Lucan—</p>

however, be scarcely any doubt that he was speaking of M. Annæus
Seneca the rhetorician, and his son Lucius the philosopher.
Sidonius Apollinaris,<a id='r1039' /><a href='#f1039' class='c012'><sup>[1039]</sup></a> the son-in-law of the Emperor Flavius
Avitus, and Bishop of Clermont,<a id='r1040' /><a href='#f1040' class='c012'><sup>[1040]</sup></a> in the last years of the Roman
empire, unhesitatingly draws a distinction between them. He
enumerates three members of the Cordovan family:—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Quorum unus colit hispidum Platonem,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c022'>But, notwithstanding the celebrity which Sidonius enjoyed as a
poet at the imperial court, his opinion is of no authority when
weighed against the internal evidence derived from the tragedies
themselves. This renders it almost morally certain, that they
are the work of no other writer than Seneca the philosopher.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although the Romans, as being imitators of the Greeks, and
not original thinkers, were eclectics in philosophy, their favourite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>doctrines were those of the Stoics. They suited the rigid sternness
of their character: they imbodied that spirit of self-devotion
and self-denial with which the Roman patriot, in the old times
of simple republican virtue, threw himself into his public duties;
and Seneca, with all his faults, was a real Roman: with all his
finesse and artful policy, he retained, in the midst of a debased
age and a profligate court, a large portion of the old Roman
character. In life and in death his was a true specimen of the
Stoic creed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still he was by no means a consistent man: his theory was
perfect, but his practice often fell short of it. The lessons of
morality contained in his philosophical works are excellent, and
persuasively enforced, and wear an appearance of honesty and
sincerity; but, nevertheless, in his philosophy, as well as in his
life, we can discover that his moral principles were unstable and
wavering. These two features can be traced in his tragedies:
they abound in philosophical dogmas and moral sentiments, and
they display the same Stoicism mingled with occasional habits of
inconsistency. Suicide is painted in the most attractive colours:
death is met not only with courage, but with the same indifference
with which Seneca himself, together with other victims of
imperial tyranny, met it in his own day. It is not welcomed,
as in the Greek tragedians, as a relief from the burden of earthly
sorrows; but there is a manifest departure from the Greek model:
the natural beauty of that model is violated, and the features of
the original character sacrificed to Stoical coldness and want of
feeling.</p>

<p class='c011'>But not only are these tragedies filled with philosophical reflections;
even the sentiments enunciated in the acknowledged
works of Seneca, in his Essays and Epistles, are transferred to
them, and the peculiar turns of expression used by the philosopher
are repeated by the poet. A brilliant French author<a id='r1041' /><a href='#f1041' class='c012'><sup>[1041]</sup></a> has
ingeniously brought together and compared parallel passages,
which illustrate this similarity of sentiment and style. A few
of these are sufficient as examples. Two in the “<cite class='quote'>Phœnissæ</cite>,” in
which Œdipus insists on “the liberty of dying,” imbody the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>doctrine as two others, one in the epistles to Lucilius, the other
in the treatise on Providence.</p>

<div class='c016'>

<p class='c021'>He (says Œdipus) who compels one who is unwilling to die does
the same as he who hinders one who is eager for death; nay, I consider
the latter treats me the worse of the two. I had rather that death
were forced upon me than that the privilege of dying should be torn
from me.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c022'>And again the same favourite sentiment appears:—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<p class='c021'>I cannot be prevented from dying; of what availeth all that care of
thine? Death is everywhere. Most wisely has God provided for this.
There is no one who cannot rob a man of life, but no one can rob him
of death; to this a thousand roads are open.</p>

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>With these are compared the following sentences of the philosopher,
in which not only the doctrines, but also the language
in which they are expressed, are so strikingly parallel as scarcely
to admit of a doubt that the authors are identical:—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<p class='c021'>To live under compulsion is an evil; but there is no compulsion to
live under compulsion. Many roads to liberty lie open on all sides,
short and easy. Let us thank God that no one can be retained in life.</p>

</div>

<p class='c022'>And, again, Divine Providence is represented as declaring to
mankind:—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<p class='c021'>Before all things I have provided that no one should detain you
against your will—an exit is open to you.</p>

<p class='c021'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Malum est in necessitate vivere, sed in necessitate vivere necessitas
nulla est. <i>Patent</i> undique ad libertatem <i>viæ multæ</i>, breves, faciles.
Agamus Deo gratias, quod nemo in vitâ teneri potest.—Ep. xii.</span></p>

</div>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span></div>
<div class='c016'>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ante omnia <i>cavi</i>, ne quis vos teneret invitos, patet exitus.</div>
      <div class='line in42'><cite>De Provident.</cite> vi.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>How exactly in accordance with these sentiments, whether expressed
in poetry or prose, is the closing scene of Seneca’s life;
the almost business-like way in which he entered upon the road
which was appointed to lead him from the dominion of necessity
to the enjoyment of liberty—the imperturbable coolness with
which he could contemplate the death of his wife, whom he loved
with the greatest affection!<a id='r1042' /><a href='#f1042' class='c012'><sup>[1042]</sup></a> How calculated, moreover, were
they to engage the sympathies of his contemporaries! It was
an age in which, amidst its various corruptions, the only virtue
which survived was the knowing how to meet death with a
courageous spirit, in which many of the best and the noblest
willingly died by their own hands at the imperial mandate, in
order to save their name from infamy, and the inheritance of
their children from confiscation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, an awful belief in destiny, and the hopeless, yet
patient, struggle of a great and good man against this all-ruling
power, is the mainspring of Greek tragedy. This is not transferred
into the imitations of the Romans. Its place is supplied
by the stern fatalism of the Stoics. The principle of destiny
entertained by the Greek poets is a mythological, even a
religious one: it is the irresistible will of God. God is at the
commencement of the chain of causes and effects by which the
event is brought about which God has ordained; his inspired
prophets have power to foretell, and mortals cannot resist or
avoid. It is rather predestination than destiny. The doctrine
implies an intelligent agent, not a mere abstract principle.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fatalism of the Stoics, on the other hand, is the doctrine
of practical necessity. It ignores the almighty power of the Supreme
Being, although it does not deny his existence. It strips
him of his attributes as the moral Governor of the universe.
These doctrines are found both in the philosopher and tragic
poet. Translate the subjoined prose passage into the conventional
language of poetry, adopt as a mere matter of embellishment
the fables of Greek mythology, personify the Stoical principle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>of necessity by the Greek Fates, and it becomes the
Chorus in the Latin tragedy Œdipus. Both these passages are
quoted by Nisard:—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<p class='c021'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Nihil cogor nihil patior invitus</i>; nec servio Deo, sed assentior; eo
quidem magis, quod scio <i>omnia certa</i> et in æternum dicta lege decurrere.
<i>Fata nos ducunt</i>, et quantum cuique restat, <i>prima nascentium hora
disposuit. Causa pendet ex causa</i>; privata ac publica <i>longus ordo</i> rerum
trahit. Ideo fortiter omne ferendum est; quia non, ut putamus, incidunt
cuncta, sed veniunt. Olim constitutum est quid gaudeas, quid fleas; et
quamvis magna videatur varietate singulorum vita distingui, summa in
unum venit; accepimus peritura perituri.</span></p>

<div class='c040'><i>De Provid.</i> v.</div>

<p class='c021'>I am neither compelled to do or to suffer anything against my will.
I am not a slave to God, but I bow to his will. The more so because
I know that all things are fixed and proceed according to an everlasting
law. Destiny is our guide, and the hour of our birth has disposed
all the remainder of our lives. Each cause depends upon a preceding
one; a long chain of circumstances links together all things, both
public and private. Therefore we must bear all things with fortitude,
since all things <i>come to pass</i>, and do not, as we suppose, <i>happen</i>. Our
joys or sorrows have been determined long ago; and although a great
variety of items distinguishes the lives of individuals, the sum total is
the same. Perishable creatures ourselves, that which we have received
is perishable likewise.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>A comparison of the above with the following passage exhibits
a similarity which could only have proceeded from the
same mind and the same pen; for it is to be remembered, that
though the Romans were imitators of the Greeks, they did not
copy one another; and throughout the whole field of Roman
literature no example could be found of a poet transferring to
his works the exact sentiments, tone of thought, and turn of expression
of another Latin author:—</p>

<div class='c016'>

</div>

</div>

<div class='c016'>

<p class='c021'>We are led by destiny—yield then to its power. Anxious care cannot
change the thread spun by the distaff of the Fates. Whatever we
mortals do or suffer comes from on high; and Lachesis observes the
decrees of the wheel which revolves beneath her pitiless hand. All
things proceed in a fixed path, and the first day of life has determined
the last. God has not power to change the chain of causes and effects.
Each has its fixed order, which no prayers can alter.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>Even the philosophical inconsistencies<a id='r1043' /><a href='#f1043' class='c012'><sup>[1043]</sup></a> traceable in the prose
treatises are repeated in the tragedies. In one letter<a id='r1044' /><a href='#f1044' class='c012'><sup>[1044]</sup></a> he affirms
his belief that the soul of Scipio Africanus has ascended into
heaven as a reward of his virtue and piety; in another<a id='r1045' /><a href='#f1045' class='c012'><sup>[1045]</sup></a> he
asserts the gloomy doctrine that death is annihilation: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mors est
non esse</span>.” In like manner in the “<cite class='quote'>Troades</cite>” the Chorus declares
that the happy Priam wanders amongst pious souls in the
“safe Elysian shades;”<a id='r1046' /><a href='#f1046' class='c012'><sup>[1046]</sup></a> and yet, with an inconsistency which the
Letters of the philosopher alone account for, another passage in
the same tragedy declares that the spirit vanishes like smoke,
that after death is nothingness, and death itself is nothing.<a id='r1047' /><a href='#f1047' class='c012'><sup>[1047]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>On such internal evidence as this rests the probability, almost
amounting to certainty, that Seneca the philosopher, and the
author of the ten tragedies, are one and the same.<a id='r1048' /><a href='#f1048' class='c012'><sup>[1048]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Notwithstanding their false rhetorical taste, and the absence
of all ideal and creative genius, the tragedies of Seneca found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>many admirers and imitators in modern times. The French
school of tragic poets took them for their model: Corneille evidently
considered them the ideal of tragedy, and Racine servilely
imitated them. Their philosophy captivated an age
which thought that nothing was so sublime as heathen philosophy;
and yet that same age derived its notions of ancient philosophy
from the Romans instead of from the original Greek
sources; and its poetical taste, as far as it was classical, was
formed on a study of Roman dramatic literature, before the
excellence of the Attic drama was sufficiently known to be appreciated.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Aulus Persius Flaccus</span> (<span class='fss'>BORN A. D.</span> 34.)</h4>

<p class='c018'>Roman satire subsequently to Horace is represented by Aulus
Persius Flaccus and Decimus Junius Juvenalis. Persius was a
member of an equestrian family, and was born, according to the
Eusebian Chronicle, <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 34, at Volaterræ in Etruria. He was
related to the best families in Italy, and numbered amongst his
kindred Arria, the noble-minded wife of Pætus. His father
died when he was six years old, and his mother, Fulvia Sisenna,
married a second time a Roman knight named Fusius. In a few
years she was again a widow. Persius received his elementary
education at his native town; but at twelve years of age he was
brought to Rome, and went through the usual course of grammar
and rhetoric, under Remmius Palæmon<a id='r1049' /><a href='#f1049' class='c012'><sup>[1049]</sup></a> and Virginius Flavus.<a id='r1050' /><a href='#f1050' class='c012'><sup>[1050]</sup></a>
The former of these was, like so many men of letters, a freedman,
and the son of a slave. He was, according to Suetonius,<a id='r1051' /><a href='#f1051' class='c012'><sup>[1051]</sup></a>
a man of profligate morals, but gifted with great fluency of
speech, and a prodigious memory. He was rather a versifier
than a poet, and, like so many modern Italians, possessed the
talent of improvising. He was prosperous as a schoolmaster,
considering the very small pittance which the members of that
profession usually earned, for his school brought him in forty
sestertia per annum (about 325<i>l.</i><a id='r1052' /><a href='#f1052' class='c012'><sup>[1052]</sup></a>) Virginius Flavus is only

</div>

<p class='c011'>At sixteen, Persius attached himself to the Stoic philosopher
Annæus Cornutus, by whom he was imbued with the stern philosophical
principles which occupy so prominent a place in his
Satires. The friendship which he formed thus early in life continued
until the day of his death. The young Lucan was also
one of his intimate associates, whose philosophical and poetical
tastes were similar to his own, and who had a profound admiration
for his writings. He was acquainted with Seneca, but had
no very great regard either for him or his works. Cæsius Bassus,
to whom he addressed his sixth Satire, was also one of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>intimates.<a id='r1055' /><a href='#f1055' class='c012'><sup>[1055]</sup></a> It redounds greatly to his honour that he enjoyed
the friendship of Pætus Thrasea, one of the noblest examples of
Roman virtue.<a id='r1056' /><a href='#f1056' class='c012'><sup>[1056]</sup></a> Persius died prematurely of a disease in the
stomach, at the age of twenty-eight. He left a large fortune to
his mother and sister; and his library, consisting of seven hundred
volumes, together with a considerable pecuniary legacy, to
his beloved tutor, Cornutus. The philosopher, however, disinterestedly
gave up the money to the sister of his deceased friend.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pure in mind and chaste in life, Persius was free from the
corrupt taint of an immoral age. He exhibited all the self-denial,
the control of the passions, and the stern uncompromising
principles of the philosophy which he admired, but not its hypocrisy.
Stoicism was not, in his case, as in that of so many
others, a cloak for vice and profligacy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although Lucretius was, to a certain extent, his model, he does
not attack vice with the biting severity of the old satirist. He
rather adopts the caustic irony of the old Greek comedy, as more
in accordance with that style of attack which he himself terms—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c022'>Nor do we find in his writings the fiery ardour, the enthusiastic
indignation, which burn in the verses of Juvenal; but this
resulted from the tenderness of his heart and the gentleness of
his disposition, and not from any disqualification for the duties
of a moral instructor, such as weak moral principle, or irresolute
timidity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although he must have been conscious that the dangerous times
during which his short life was passed rendered caution necessary,
still it is far more probable that his purity of mind and kindliness
of heart disinclined him to portray vice in its hideous and
loathsome forms, and to indulge in bitterness of invective which
prevalent enormities of his times deserved. It may be questioned
whether obscenities like those of Juvenal, notwithstanding purity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>of intention, best promote the interests of virtue. It is to be
feared that often the passions are excited and the human heart
rendered more corrupt by descriptions of vice, whilst the moral
lesson is disregarded.</p>

<p class='c011'>Persius evidently believed that reserve and silence, or those
abominations which make the pure-minded shudder with horror,
and call up a blush upon the cheek of innocence, would more
safely maintain the dignity and purity of virtue, than the divesting
himself of that virgin modesty (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">virgineus ille pudor</span></i>) which
constituted the great charm of his character. His uprightness
and love of virtue are shown by the uncompromising severity
with which he rebukes sins of not so deep a die; and the heart
which was capable of being moulded by his example, and influenced
by his purity, would have shrunk from the fearful crimes
which defile the pages of Juvenal.</p>

<p class='c011'>The greatest defect in Persius, as a satirist, is, that the philosophy
in which he was educated rendered him too indifferent to
the affairs which were going on in the world around him. Politics
had little interest for him: he lived within himself a meditative
life; wealth and splendour he despised. His contemplative
habits led him to criticise, as his favourite subjects, false taste in
poetry and empty pretensions to philosophy. His modest and
retiring nature found little sympathy with the passions, the tumults,
the business, or the pleasures which agitated Rome. He
was more a student of the closet than a man of the world. Horace
mingled in the society of the profligate; he considered them
as fools; and laughed their folly to scorn. Juvenal looked down
upon the corruption of the age from an eminence, where, involved
in his virtue, he was safe from moral pollution, and punished it
like an avenging deity. Persius, pure in heart and passionless
by education, whilst he lashes wickedness in the abstract, almost
ignores its existence, and modestly shrinks from laying bare the
secret pollutions of the human heart, and from probing its vileness
to the bottom. The amiability, and above all the disinterestedness,
which characterize his Satires, fully account for the
popularity which they attained immediately on their publication
by Cornutus, and the panegyrics of which he was the subject in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>later times. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Persius</span>,” writes Quintilian,<a id='r1058' /><a href='#f1058' class='c012'><sup>[1058]</sup></a> “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">multum et veræ
gloriæ, quamvis uno libro meruit</span>.” Many of the early Christian
writers thought that his merits fully compensated for the obscurity
of his style; and Gifford<a id='r1059' /><a href='#f1059' class='c012'><sup>[1059]</sup></a> observes, “The virtue he recommends
he practised in the fullest extent; and, at an age when
few have acquired a determinate character, he left behind him
an established reputation for genius, learning, and worth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The works of Persius are comprised within the compass of six
Satires, containing, in all, about 650 lines. And from the expression
of Quintilian, already cited, and supported by a passage
of Martial, there is reason to suppose that all he wrote is now
extant. To his Satires is prefixed a short but spirited introduction
in choliambics, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i> lame iambics, in which, for the iambus
in the sixth place, there is substituted a spondee.</p>

<p class='c011'>This proëmium bears but little relation to his work; but he
was accustomed to similar irrelevancy in the parabases of the old
Attic comedy, which he had studied. In his first Satire he exposes
and accounts for the false and immoral taste which affected
poetry and forensic eloquence, attacks the coxcombry of public
recitation, and parodies the style of contemporary writers, in
language which our ignorance of them prevents us from appreciating.
In the second, which is a congratulatory address to
his dear friend Macrinus on his birthday, he imbodies the subject-matter
of the second Alcibiades of Plato;<a id='r1060' /><a href='#f1060' class='c012'><sup>[1060]</sup></a> a dialogue which
Juvenal also had in view in the composition of his tenth Satire.
In this poem, the degrading ideas which men have formed respecting
the Deity, the consequent selfishness and even impiety
of their prayers, are followed by sentiments on the true nature
of prayer, which even a Christian can read with admiration:—</p>

<p class='c011'>In the fourth Satire, Nero is represented in the character of
Alcibiades; and Plato’s first Dialogue, which bears the name of
the Athenian Libertine, furnished the foundation and many of
the sentiments.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fifth is the most elaborate of all the poet’s works. It is
addressed to Cornutus, and is in the form of a dialogue between
the philosopher and his pupil. The style is more finished than
usual, and more adorned with the graces of poetry; his amiable
nature beams forth in all the warmth of a grateful heart; and
although he does not display any original philosophical research,
he exhibits great learning, and an accurate acquaintance with
the Stoic philosophy.</p>

<p class='c011'>If the fifth Satire is the most elaborate, the sixth is, without
doubt, the most delightful of the works of Persius. It is addressed
to his dear friend Cæsius Bassus, and overflows with
kindness of heart. The poet speaks of the duties of contentment,
and of ministering to the distresses of others; the hatefulness of
envy; the meanness of avarice, beneath whatever disguise it
may be veiled; his own determination to use and not abuse his
fortune; whilst there may be traced through the whole a foreboding,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>yet a cheerful one, that his weary course will soon be
run, and that his heir will soon succeed to his possessions.<a id='r1065' /><a href='#f1065' class='c012'><sup>[1065]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Such was the character of Persius as mirrored in his little
volume. The gloomy sullenness of Stoicism was not able to destroy
the natural amiability and placid cheerfulness of his temper.
Its darkness affected his style, but not his disposition. The fault
which has been universally found with the style of Persius, is
difficulty and obscurity. This would be the natural consequence
of his Stoical education. The Stoics were proverbially obscure
and dark in their teaching; and Persius, who had not imbibed
all the profoundness of their philosophy, had still caught their
language and their manner of expression, and whilst he was infected
by their faults he acquired also their picturesqueness and
liveliness of illustration. Nor does it appear that his style was
considered obscure enough by his contemporaries to interfere
with its popularity. It is probable that his obscurity is not absolute,
but only relative to the knowledge of the language possessed
in modern times. His was the conversational Latin of
the days in which he lived; and as a great change had taken
place from the Latin of Cicero and Livy to that of Tacitus and
Seneca, doubtless the conversational Latin of Horace, and even
of Juvenal, would differ from that of Persius. If this be the
case, the Satires of Persius constitute the only example of this
Latin, and we have no other by a comparison of which we can
explain and illustrate his modes of expression. Whatever, therefore,
is unusual becomes at once a source of difficulty and obscurity.<a id='r1066' /><a href='#f1066' class='c012'><sup>[1066]</sup></a>
The short description which Persius represents his preceptor
as giving of his style, supports this assertion:—</p>

<p class='c011'>As the <i>toga</i> had, since the time of Augustus, been only worn
by the higher orders, whilst the common people were content
with the <i>tunica</i>, it is clear that the words <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">verba togæ</span></i> signify the
language of polished society. One cause, therefore, of the difficulty
of the style of Persius may be our want of familiarity with
the conversational Latin used in his time by the superior classes.
Excessive subtlety may have been mistaken for refinement; and
an affectation of philosophy, and an enigmatical style, may cause
obscurity to us which was quite intelligible to his contemporaries.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is evident that Persius had carefully studied, and was quite
well acquainted with, the Satires of Horace; but the influence
which Horace produced upon his mind went no further than to
impress upon his memory certain phrases which he reproduced

Latin of his day. The expression of Horace—</p>

later. When in one place he describes the ardour and enthusiasm
which pervaded Rome, on the announcement of a new work by

<p class='c022'>In another,<a id='r1081' /><a href='#f1081' class='c012'><sup>[1081]</sup></a> like Horace, he complains of the annoyance of these
recitations; and in a third,<a id='r1082' /><a href='#f1082' class='c012'><sup>[1082]</sup></a> he considers it one of the causes
which rendered the most desolate and solitary country-place
preferable to Rome.</p>

<p class='c011'>The style of writing, therefore, suitable to this practice, was
a declamatory one, as the practice itself was in accordance with
the oratorical tastes of the Roman people.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Juvenal.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Decimus Junius Juvenalis, according to the few lines of biography
generally attributed to Suetonius, was the son, or the
adopted son, of a wealthy freedman. He amused himself with
rhetoric and declamation until middle life; but having, on one
occasion, written a short satire upon Paris, the pantomime, he
was tempted to apply himself to this species of writing. After
some time he recited his piece with such success to a large audience,
that he inserted it in one of his later compositions.<a id='r1083' /><a href='#f1083' class='c012'><sup>[1083]</sup></a> He
thus exposed himself to the enmity of the court, because his lines
were supposed figuratively to apply to an actor who was a court
favourite, and he was exiled to Egypt, under pretence of being
appointed to the command of a cohort. There in a short time
he died of grief at the age of eighty.</p>

<p class='c011'>The time of his birth is unknown, but he must have flourished
in the reign of Domitian, towards the close of the first century
after Christ; and it is generally assumed that he was either born,
or resided, at the Volscian town which subsequently gave birth
to the eminent schoolman, Thomas Aquinas.<a id='r1084' /><a href='#f1084' class='c012'><sup>[1084]</sup></a> Thus the greater
portion of the life of Juvenal was passed during a period of
political horror and misery. The short reign of Vespasian was
doubtless a blessing to Rome, but it was only a brief temporary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>respite: the dark period of the last ten Cæsars saw the utter
moral degradation of the people, and the bloodiest tyranny and
oppression on the part of their rulers. If, which is most probable,
he lived to see the reigns of Nerva, Trajan, and Hadrian,
the spirits of the noble-minded satirist must have revived at
seeing again a promise of national glory and prosperity. In
the period gone by, rich as it was in material for his pen, it was
fatally perilous to give utterance to his burning indignation;
but an opportunity, not to be lost, was then offered when emperors
ruled, who were distinguished for ability and virtue, when
justice and the laws were constitutionally administered, and the
empire, wisely governed, enjoyed security and tranquillity.</p>

<p class='c011'>The picture of Roman manners, as painted by the glowing
pencil of Juvenal, is truly appalling. The fabric of society was
in ruins. The popular religion was rejected with scorn, and its
place was not occupied even by the creed of natural religion.
Nothing remained but the empty pomp, pageant and ceremonial.
The administration of the state was a mass of corruption: freedmen
and foreigners, full of artful cunning, but destitute of principle,
had the ear of the sovereign, and filled their coffers with
bribes and confiscation. The grave and decent reserve which
was characteristic of every Roman, in olden times, was thrown
off even by the higher classes; and emperors took a public part
in scenes of folly and profligacy, and exposed themselves as
charioteers, as dancers, and as actors. Nothing was respected
but wealth—nothing provoked contempt but poverty.<a id='r1085' /><a href='#f1085' class='c012'><sup>[1085]</sup></a> A vote
was only valued for its worth in money; that people, whose
power was once absolute, would now sell their souls for bread
and the Circensian games.</p>

<p class='c011'>Players and dancers had all honours and offices at their disposal.
The city swarmed with informers who made the rich
their prey: every man feared even his most intimate friend.
To be noble, virtuous, innocent, was no protection: the only
bond of friendship was to be an accomplice in crime. Philosophy
was a cheat, and moral teaching an hypocrisy. The moralists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>“preached like Curii, but lived like bacchanals.”<a id='r1086' /><a href='#f1086' class='c012'><sup>[1086]</sup></a> The
very teacher would do his best to corrupt his pupil: the guardian
would defraud his ward. Luxury and extravagance brought
men to ruin, which they sought to repair by flattering the childless,
legacy-hunting, and gambling; and even patricians would
cringe for a morsel of bread. The higher classes were selfish
and cruel, grinding and insolent to their inferiors and dependants.<a id='r1087' /><a href='#f1087' class='c012'><sup>[1087]</sup></a>
Gluttony was so disgusting that six thousand sesterces
(50<i>l.</i>) would be given for a mullet; and the glutton would artificially
relieve his stomach of its load, in order to prepare for
another meal.<a id='r1088' /><a href='#f1088' class='c012'><sup>[1088]</sup></a> Crimes which cannot be named were common:
men, for the worst of purposes, endeavoured to make themselves
look like women; and even an emperor personated a female,
and was given in marriage to one of his Greek favourites.<a id='r1089' /><a href='#f1089' class='c012'><sup>[1089]</sup></a> The
streets of Rome were as dangerous as the Pomptine marshes or
the Italian forests, from constant robbery, assault, and assassination.</p>

<p class='c011'>The morals of the female sex were as depraved as those of men:
ladies of noble and royal blood would have lovers in their pay,
and when they had lost the attraction of personal charms, would
supply their place by the temptation of gold. One empress
publicly celebrated her nuptials with an adulterer in the absence
of her lord; another gratified her wantonness by prostitution.
Even those who were not so profligate aped the manners
and habits of men, and would even meet in mock combat;
and there was no public amusement so immoral or so cruel as
not to be disgraced by the presence of the female sex. Licentiousness
led to murder; and poisoning by women was as common
as it was in France and Italy in the sixteenth century.<a id='r1090' /><a href='#f1090' class='c012'><sup>[1090]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Times like these would even have shocked the urbane and
gentle Horace. Had he then lived, he would probably have
thought such vice beyond ridicule, and his tone might have approached
more nearly to the thundering indignation of Juvenal.
“Society in the age of Horace was becoming corrupt; in that
of Juvenal it was in a state of putrefaction.”<a id='r1091' /><a href='#f1091' class='c012'><sup>[1091]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>In this period of moral dearth the fountains of genius and
literature were dried up. The orator dared not impeach the
corrupt politician, or defend the victim of tyranny, when every
one thought the best way to secure his own safety was by trampling
on the fallen favourite, now Cæsar’s enemy.<a id='r1092' /><a href='#f1092' class='c012'><sup>[1092]</sup></a> The historian
dared not utter his real sentiments. Poetry grew cold without
the genial, fostering encouragement of noble and affectionate
hearts. There was criticism, grammar, declamation, panegyric
and verse-writing, but not oratory, history, or poetry. Juvenal,
though himself not free from the declamatory affectation of the
day, attacked the false literary taste of his contemporaries as
unsparingly as he did their depraved morality. From Sejanus
to Cluvienus he allowed no one to escape.</p>

<p class='c011'>But noble as Juvenal’s hatred of vice must be allowed to be,
and fearless as are his denunciations, we look in vain throughout
his poetry for indications of an amiable and kind-hearted
disposition. He was not one to recall the lost and erring to a
love of virtue, or to inspire a pure and enthusiastic taste for
literature. His prejudices were violent; he could see nothing
good in a Greek or a freedman: he hated the new aristocracy
with as bitter a hatred as Sallust. As a critic he is ill-natured;
as a moralist he is stern and misanthrophic. Mark, for example,
the gloomy bitterness with which he speaks of old age,<a id='r1093' /><a href='#f1093' class='c012'><sup>[1093]</sup></a> and
contrast it with the bright side of the picture, as drawn by the
gentle Cicero in his incomparable treatise.</p>

<p class='c011'>Deficient, however, as he was in the softer affections, his sixteen
Satires exhibit an enlightened, truthful, and comprehensive
view of Roman manners, and of the inevitable result of such
corruption. Those whose moral taste was utterly destroyed
would read and listen without profit, but they could not but
tremble: his words are truth. The conclusion of the thirteenth
Satire is almost Christian. It is unnecessary to quote from an
author who is in every scholar’s memory: it would even occupy
too much space to make a fair selection from so many fine passages.
The eleventh Satire is the most pleasing, and most partaking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>of the playfulness of Horace. The seventh displays the
greatest versatility and the richest fund of anecdote. The
twelfth is the most amiable. The description of the origin of
civil society in the conclusion of the fifteenth is full of sound
sense and just sentiments; whilst the way in which he speaks of
the insane bigotry of the Egyptians, exhibits his power of combining
pleasantry with dignity. But the two finest Satires are
those<a id='r1094' /><a href='#f1094' class='c012'><sup>[1094]</sup></a> which our own Johnson has thought worthy of imitation:
one of which (the tenth) Bishop Burnet, in his Pastoral Charge,
recommended to his clergy; and the noblest passage in them is
that which describes the fall of the infamous Sejanus.<a id='r1095' /><a href='#f1095' class='c012'><sup>[1095]</sup></a> Few
men could be so well adapted to transfer the spirit of Juvenal
into English as Dr. Johnson. He had the same rude, plain-spoken,
uncompromising hatred of vice; and, though not unamiable,
did his best to conceal what amiability he possessed under
a forbidding exterior. He was not without gayety and sprightliness;
but he concealed it under that stateliness and declamatory
grandeur which he attributes to Juvenal.</p>

<p class='c011'>The historical value of Juvenal’s Satires must not be forgotten.
Tacitus lived in the same perilous times as he did; and when
they had come to an end, and it was not unsafe to speak, he
wrote their public history. Juvenal illustrates that history by
displaying the social inner life of the Romans.<a id='r1096' /><a href='#f1096' class='c012'><sup>[1096]</sup></a> Their works
are parallel, and each forms a commentary upon the other.
When such were the lives of individuals, one cannot wonder at
the fate of the nation.</p>

<p class='c011'>The style of Juvenal is, generally speaking, the reflex of his
mind: his views were strong and clear: his style is vigorous and
lucid also. His morals were pure in the midst of a debased age:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>his language shines forth in classic elegance in the midst of specimens
of declining and degenerate taste. His style is declamatory,
but it is not artificially rhetorical. He could not restrain
himself from following the example of Lucilius: he could
not dam up the torrent of his vehement and natural eloquence.
Whether his subject is noble or disgusting, his word-painting is
perfect: we feel his sublimity—we shudder at his fidelity. The
nature of the subject causes his language to be frequently gross
and offensive; but his object always is to lay bare the deformity
of vice, and to render it loathsome. He never indulges in
indecency, in order to pander to a corrupt taste or to gratify a
prurient imagination. For this reason his pages are less dangerous
than those of more elegant and less indecent writers,
who throw a veil over indelicacy, whilst they leave those qualities
which blind the moral vision and inflame the passions. It
must be remembered, also, that neither the dress, manners, nor
conversation of ancient Rome were so decent and modest as
those of modern times; and, therefore, Roman taste would not
be so shocked by plain speaking as would be the case in an age
of greater social refinement. Juvenal closes the list of Roman
satirists, properly speaking: the satirical spirit animates the piquant
epigrams of his friend Martial; but their purpose is not
moral or didactic: they sting the individual, and render him an
object of scorn and disgust, but they do not hold up vice itself to
ridicule and detestation.</p>

</div>
<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>M. Annæus Lucanus</span> (<span class='fss'>BORN A. D.</span> 39.)</h4>

<p class='c018'>At the head of the epic poets who flourished during the silver
age stands Lucan. He was a member of the same family as the
Senecas, for the same rhetorician of that name was his grandfather,
and the Stoic philosopher his uncle. Another of his uncles,
also, L. Junius Gallio, is mentioned in the Eusebian Chronicle
as a celebrated rhetorician. This Gallio derived his surname
from being the adopted son of Jun. Gallio, who, by some, is supposed
to have been the proconsul of Achaia, mentioned in the
Acts of the Apostles.<a id='r1097' /><a href='#f1097' class='c012'><sup>[1097]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The father of Lucan, M. Annæus Mela, was a Roman knight,
who made a large fortune as a collector of the imperial revenue.
He is supposed by some to have been identical with the geographer
Pomponius Mela, who was the author of a brief description,
in three books, of the coasts of Europe, Asia, and Africa. The
style of this writer is concise, as is suitable to a mere sketch or
abridgment; and his matter, although derived from other sources,
and not from personal observation, is accurate and interesting.
The poet was born at Corduba (Cordova,) on the beautiful banks
of the Bætis (Guadalquiver.) His birthplace is thus elegantly
alluded to by Statius, in a poem addressed to his widow, on the
anniversary of his birth:—</p>

<p class='c011'>Pliny tells us that on his infant lips, as on those of Hesiod, a
swarm of bees settled, and thus gave presage of his poetical career;
a tale which owes its origin entirely to the Greek tradition.
Much which rests upon no foundation has been mixed up with
the extant lives of Lucan; for example, the favour shown to him,
whilst a child, by Nero; his consequent elevation in his boyhood
to the rank of a senator; and his defeat of the emperor in a poetical
contest at the quinquennial games, instituted by the latter,
in which no one entered with any other view than that their
royal antagonist might have the credit of a mock victory.<a id='r1098' /><a href='#f1098' class='c012'><sup>[1098]</sup></a> The
enmity of the jealous emperor can be accounted for without
having recourse to so insane a competition.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is probable that Lucan was very young when he came to
Rome; that his literary reputation was soon established; and
that Nero, who could not bear the idea of a rival, forbade him
to recite his poems, which was now the common mode of publication.
Nor was he content with silencing him as a poet, but
also would not allow him to plead as an advocate.<a id='r1099' /><a href='#f1099' class='c012'><sup>[1099]</sup></a> Smarting
under this provocation he hastily joined a conspiracy against the
emperor’s life, and signalized himself by the bitterness of his
hatred against his powerful enemy. The ringleader of this plot
was Piso,<a id='r1100' /><a href='#f1100' class='c012'><sup>[1100]</sup></a> a tragic poet of some talent, a skilful orator, and a
munificent man. But he was deficient in decision and infirm of
purpose: the plot therefore failed. When Lucan’s passion cooled
he as quickly repented, and was pardoned on condition of pointing
out his confederates. In the vain hope of saving himself from
the monster’s vengeance, he actually impeached his mother. The
upright historian contrasts this stain on the poet’s character with
the courage which Epicharis displayed. This noble woman was
incapable of treason. Tacitus describes the resolution with which
she scorned the question.<a id='r1101' /><a href='#f1101' class='c012'><sup>[1101]</sup></a> “The scourge, the flames, the rage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>of the executioners, who tortured her the more savagely, lest
they should be scorned by a woman, were powerless to extort a
false confession.” Lucan never received the reward which he
purchased by treachery. The warrant for his death was issued,
and he caused his veins to be cut asunder. As the stream of
his life’s blood flowed away, he repeated from his own poem the
description of a soldier expiring from his wounds.<a id='r1102' /><a href='#f1102' class='c012'><sup>[1102]</sup></a> He died in
the twenty-seventh year of his age; and the following inscription
to his memory has been attributed to Nero:—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>The sentiments contained in the Pharsalia, so far as he dared
express them, breathe a love of freedom, and an attachment to
the old Roman republicanism. Although the imperial patronage
which he at first enjoyed, and, perhaps, the better promise of
the commencement of Nero’s reign, tempted him to indulge in
courtly flattery; still, even at that time, his praises of liberty
evidently came from the heart. As the poem proceeds his sentiments
become more exalted; his virtuous indignation gradually
rises, until it pours forth a torrent of burning satire on the inhuman
tyrant. This poem, the only one of his works which
survives, is an epic in ten books; its subject, the civil war between
Cæsar and Pompey. It bears evident marks of having
been left unfinished, and of not having received the last touches
from the hand of the author. It was preceded by four other
shorter poems—the first on the Death of Hector; the second on
the Visit of Orpheus to the Infernal Regions; the third, on the
Burning of Rome; the fourth addressed to his wife Polla Argentaria.
He also wrote some prose works; and Martial attributes
to him some poems on lighter subjects.<a id='r1103' /><a href='#f1103' class='c012'><sup>[1103]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Lucan is an unequal poet: his Pharsalia is defaced with great
faults and blemishes; but at the same time it possesses peculiar
beauties. Its subject is a noble one and full of historic interest,
and is treated with spirit, brilliance, and animation. Its arrangement
is that of annals, and therefore it wants the unity of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>epic poem: it has not the connectedness of history, because the
poet naturally selected only the most striking and romantic incidents;
and yet, notwithstanding these defects in the plan, the
historical pictures themselves are beautifully drawn. The
characters of Cæsar and Pompey, for example, are master-pieces.
Again, some passages have neither the dignity of prose nor the
melody of poetry; whilst others are scarcely inferior to any
written by the best Latin poets. This inequality has caused the
great diversity of opinions which have been held by critics respecting
the merits of Lucan. Some have unjustly depreciated
him; others, as groundlessly, have lauded him to the skies.
Quintilian commended his ardent enthusiasm and lucidity of
expression,<a id='r1104' /><a href='#f1104' class='c012'><sup>[1104]</sup></a> but qualified his praise by adding, that he would be
admired by orators rather than by poets. Corneille preferred
him to Virgil, of whom he was obviously a warm admirer.
His poem furnishes materials and reason for this diversity of
judgment; but it may safely be asserted that his faults are due
to the age in which he lived, whilst his beauties were the fruits
and developments of his own native genius. His principal
merit is originality: although he was not great enough to lead
the taste of the age, and to rise superior to its false principles,
he did not condescend to be a servile imitator even of those
poets whose reputation was firmly established. There are many
parallelisms between his poetry and that of Virgil, but they are
the parallelisms of a student, not of a plagiarist.</p>

<p class='c011'>Without adopting the unauthorized assumptions, found in some
of his biographies, that he was educated under the immediate
superintendence of his uncle Seneca, that Remmius Palæmon
taught him grammar, Virginius Flaccus rhetoric, and Cornutus<a id='t431'></a>
philosophy, it is clear that his taste was formed and his talents
drawn out in an age, the characteristics of which were pedantic
erudition, inflated rhetoric, and dogmatic philosophy. It is clear,
also, that even though Seneca was not his tutor, still the conceit
and affectation which dimmed the transcendent abilities of
the philosopher, exercised a baneful influence over the literary
taste of his contemporaries. In the midst of these influences
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>Lucan was educated, and for that reason his poem is disfigured by
commonplace maxims, pompous diction, an affectation of learning,
a rhetorical exuberance which outstripped its subjects, and therefore
produces the effect of frigidity. In a poem, the characters
and events of which are historical, the real is in too strong contrast
to the ideal, hence the effect of both is marred. The fidelity
expected of the historian circumscribes the creative power
of the poet. To the poet who constructs his work out of the materials
of epochs which are beyond the reach of history, the
whole field of the past is open. The only limits within which
he must restrain his genius are those of the probable: within
these bounds he may conjure up the most magnificent ideal forms;
he may use the most gorgeous imagery, the most supernatural
machinery: the whole wears an air of historic truth; as there are
no realities with which his ideal can be compared and tested,
truth never appears to be violated.</p>

<p class='c011'>But in history, almost contemporaneous with the age of the
poet, every circumstance is recorded, every character well known
and estimated. If an act of bravery is exaggerated into one of
superhuman heroism, or one who is known to have been a man,
although a great man, recast in the heroic mould, we are struck
at once with the falsehood: and therefore the poet cannot venture
on such efforts of genius. In a train of events, which the
page of history enables us to trace from the beginning to the
end, no difficulties can occur deserving of supernatural machinery,
no <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dignus vindice nodus</span></i>; and thus, in the place of the
Olympian Pantheon of Homer and Virgil, Lucan can only deify
the popular but unpoetical principle of chance, and personify
Fortune.</p>

<p class='c011'>This position may appear inconsistent with the charm which
confessedly belongs to the modern historical romance; but then
it is to be remembered, that the interest we take in the historical
portions is purely historical, enlivened by the events grouping
themselves round the hero: in fact, the interest of biography is
united with that of history. The strictest accuracy, therefore,
in matters which fall within the range of history is perfectly
compatible.  The romantic interest depends on the inner or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>social life of the characters—which forms no part of history—in
which, as there is no standard of comparison, the imagination of
the poet is quite free and unfettered. But this is totally different
from the plan on which such a poem as the Pharsalia is
constructed. The vision of the genius of Rome which appeared
to Cæsar at the fatal Rubicon, those which haunt the slumbers
of the Cæsareans in the plundered camp of Pompey, and the
dream of Pompey, in which the secrets of the infernal regions
are laid open by the shade of his departed wife Julia, are the
nearest approaches to that invisible world which the imagination
of Homer disclosed, and which Virgil reproduced;<a id='r1105' /><a href='#f1105' class='c012'><sup>[1105]</sup></a> but these
are only isolated passages.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is impossible to be at once an historian and a poet: in the
one character the author must restrain the flights of his imagination;
in the other, he must sacrifice truth. Nor is there any
doubt of which character we demand the conservation, when
matters of history are concerned. We desiderate truth: we wish
moot points to be settled and doubts solved. All imaginative
pictures we look upon as interruptions, and cast them aside as
warping the judgment and giving prejudiced views. Hence, our
admiration of Lucan is called forth, not by considering his poem
as an epic, but for the sake of isolated scenes, such as the naval
victory off Marseilles; splendid descriptions, such as that of the
cruelties of Marius and Sulla; felicitous comparisons, that, for
example, of Pompey to an aged oak; and the epigrammatic terseness
which gives force, as well as beauty, to his sayings. In a
single line, for instance—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c022'>he depicts the disinterestedness of Cato. To this may be added,
that the subject of the Pharsalia is, although a period of the
deepest historical interest, ill adapted to poetry. Events so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>nearly contemporary were fitter for history and panegyric than
for poetry; and although they give scope for descriptive power
and bold imagery, they are deficient in that mysterious and romantic
character which is required for an epic poem. His imagination
was rich—his enthusiasm refused to be curbed. They
were such as we might suppose would be nurtured by the warm
and sunny climate of Spain. His sentiments often exhibit that
chivalrous tone which distinguishes the Spanish poets of modern
times. We may discern the nobleness, the liberality, the courage,
which once marked the high-born Spanish gentleman; and
the grave and thoughtful wisdom which makes Spanish literature
so rich in proverbs, and which peeps out even from under the
unreal conventionalisms of the contemporary Roman philosophy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Description forms the principal feature in the poetry of Lucan;
it occupies more than one half of the Pharsalia; so that it might
almost as appropriately be termed a descriptive as an epic poem.
Description, in fact, constitutes one of the characteristic features
of Roman literature in its decline, because poetry had more than
ever become an art, and the epoch one of erudition; and thus a
treasure of imagery was stored up suitable for descriptive embellishment.
The finest parts of Persius are descriptive: even
Martial, brief though his pieces are, delights in it; and facility
in this department is the strong point of Silius Italicus, and the
sole merit of Valerius Flaccus. Owing to the enthusiasm with
which Lucan throws himself into this kind of writing, he abounds
in minute detail. He reminds one of the descriptive talent possessed
in so eminent a degree by our own Thomson. Not a
feature escapes his notice, whether it suggest ideas of the beautiful,
the sublime, or the terrible. He is not content, as Virgil
is, with a sketch—with broad lights and shadows; he delights
in a finished picture; he possesses the power of placing his subject
strongly before the eyes, leaving little or nothing for the
imagination to supply. He omits no means of attaining descriptive
truth;<a id='r1106' /><a href='#f1106' class='c012'><sup>[1106]</sup></a> the inward state of feeling, the character of each
passion, is presented, not so much in its moral and psychical as
in its physical developments; that which is internal is exhibited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>in its external symptoms, with the hand of a painter and the
skill of the physiognomist. Virgil sketches, Lucan paints; the
latter describes physically—the former philosophically. The
following passages, which describe the passage of the Rubicon
and the death of Pompey, are noble specimens of Lucan’s style:—</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>C. Silius Italicus.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>C. Silius Italicus was born in the reign of Tiberius, <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 25.
The place of his birth is unknown. His surname, Italicus, has
led some to suppose that he was a native of Italica, in Spain.
But it is not probable that, if this were the case, his friend and
fellow-courtier Martial, when he compared his eloquence to that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>of Cicero, and his poetry to that of Virgil,<a id='r1107' /><a href='#f1107' class='c012'><sup>[1107]</sup></a> called him the glory
of the Castalian sisters,<a id='r1108' /><a href='#f1108' class='c012'><sup>[1108]</sup></a> and felicitated him on his political honours,
would have forgotten to claim him as a countryman.
Others, with somewhat more show of reason, have imagined that
his birthplace was the city of Corfinium, in Pelignia, which was
called Italica,<a id='r1109' /><a href='#f1109' class='c012'><sup>[1109]</sup></a> because it was the head-quarters of the confederates
in the social war; whilst Stephens mentions a little town in
Sicily, of the same name, which might have been his native place.<a id='r1110' /><a href='#f1110' class='c012'><sup>[1110]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Silius was celebrated as an advocate; but in that age of affected
and rhetorical display, a high reputation does not prove that his
eloquence, although it might have displayed a similar elegance
of language, was more lively and stirring than his poetry. He
was consul <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 68; an office which was also filled by his son,<a id='r1111' /><a href='#f1111' class='c012'><sup>[1111]</sup></a>
and by another member of his family.<a id='r1112' /><a href='#f1112' class='c012'><sup>[1112]</sup></a> He was afterwards proconsul
of Asia; the duties of which lucrative office he appears to
have performed with credit to himself. He was very wealthy;
and, as he grew old, retired from the perils of public life to enjoy
his affluence, and the retirement of literary ease in his numerous
villas. One cannot be surprised that an orator and a
poet especially delighted in the house of Virgil, near Naples,
and the Academy of Cicero, of both which he was the fortunate
possessor. He lived to the age of seventy-five, and then starved
himself to death, because he could not bear the pain of disease.
“I have just been informed,” writes Pliny the Younger, to his
friend Caninius,<a id='r1113' /><a href='#f1113' class='c012'><sup>[1113]</sup></a> “that Silius Italicus has put an end to his existence
by starvation, at his Neapolitan villa. He had an incurable
carbuncle, from the annoyance of which he took refuge in
death, with a firm and irrevocable constancy. He enjoyed happiness
and prosperity to his dying day, if we except the loss of
the younger of his two sons; but the elder and superior one survived
him in the enjoyment of prosperity, and even of consular
rank. The belief that he had voluntarily come forward as a
public accuser injured his reputation in the reign of Nero; but,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>as a friend of Vitellius, his conduct was wise and his behaviour
courteous. His career in the proconsulate of Asia was an honourable
one, for he washed out the stain of his former activity
by a praiseworthy abstinence from public affairs. He had no
influence with the great; but then he was safe from envy. All
courted him, and were assiduous in paying their respects to him;
and as ill health confined him to his bed, his chamber was
thronged with visitors, beyond what might have been expected
from his rank and station. Whenever he could spare time for
writing, he passed it in learned conversation. His poems display
elaborate care rather than genius: sometimes he invited criticism
by recitations. Yielding to the suggestion of advancing years,
he at length retired from Rome, and resided in Campania; nor
had the accession of a new emperor (Trajan) power to entice
him from his retirement. High praise to the monarch under
whose rule he was free to act so!—high praise to him who had
courage to use that freedom! His love of virtù caused in him
a reprehensible passion for buying: he was the possessor of more
than one villa in the same localities; and he so delighted in the
newest purchase as to neglect that which he inhabited before.
He had a vast collection of books, besides statues and busts,
which he not only possessed, but almost worshipped. He kept
Virgil’s birthday more religiously than his own, and had more
busts of him than any one else, especially at Naples, where he
was in the habit of visiting his tomb, as if it were a temple. In
this tranquil retirement he exceeded his seventy-fifth year, his
constitution being delicate rather than weakly. As he was the
last consul made by Nero, so he died the last of those whom he
had made. It is also worthy of remark that the consul, in whose
year of office Nero died, died the last of Nero’s consuls. When I
call this to mind, I feel compassion for human frailty: for what
is so brief as the longest span of human life!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Little interest attaches to the biography of one who owed a
life of uninterrupted prosperity to his being the favourite and
intimate of two emperors; the one, a blood-thirsty tyrant—the
other, a gross sensualist.<a id='r1114' /><a href='#f1114' class='c012'><sup>[1114]</sup></a> His ponderous work survives—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>dullest and most tedious poem in the Latin language. Its title
is “<cite>Punica</cite>:” it consists of seventeen books, and contains a history
in heroic verse of the second Punic war. The Æneid of
Virgil was his model, and the narrative of Livy furnished his
materials. Niebuhr states that he read through the whole of
his works with great care, and that he was quite convinced that
he had taken every thing from Livy, of whose work his is only
a paraphrase.<a id='r1115' /><a href='#f1115' class='c012'><sup>[1115]</sup></a> The criticism of Pliny the Younger is, upon the
whole, just: “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scribebat carmina majori cura quam ingenio</span></i>;” for,
although it is impossible to read his poem with pleasure as a
whole, his versification is harmonious, and will often, in point
of smoothness, bear comparison with that of Virgil. The following
passage is quoted by C. Barthius as one of the most
favourable specimens of his sentiments and style; and Cellarius,
whose praise is extravagantly fulsome, gives it the epithet of
“Aurea:”—</p>

VALERIUS FLACCUS—FAULTS OF THE ARGONAUTICA—PAPINIUS STATIUS—BEAUTY OF HIS MINOR POEMS—INCAPABLE OF EPIC POETRY—DOMITIAN—EPIGRAM—MARTIAL—HIS BIOGRAPHY—PROFLIGACY OF THE AGE IN WHICH HE LIVED—IMPURITY OF HIS WRITINGS—FAVOURABLE SPECIMENS OF HIS POETRY.</span></h3>
</div>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>C. Valerius Flaccus.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>C. Valerius Flaccus flourished in the reign of Vespasian;
and, according to an epigram of Martial, in which the poet advises
his friend to leave the Muses for the drier but more profitable
profession of a pleader, he was born at Patavium<a id='r1116' /><a href='#f1116' class='c012'><sup>[1116]</sup></a> (Padua.)
The frequent addition of the surnames Setinus Balbus have
caused it to be supposed that he was a native of Setia, in Campania
(Sezzo;) but it is impossible to form any satisfactory conjecture
as to their signification, and the statement of Martial is
too definite to admit of a doubt. Quintilian<a id='r1117' /><a href='#f1117' class='c012'><sup>[1117]</sup></a> asserts that, when
he wrote, V. Flaccus had <i>lately</i> died: he was, therefore, probably
cut off prematurely about <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 88.</p>

<p class='c011'>His only poem which is extant is entitled “<cite><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Argonautica</span></cite>,” and
is an imitation, and, in some parts, a translation, of the Greek
poem of Apollonius Rhodius on the same subject. It is addressed
to the Emperor, and in the proëmium he pays a compliment to Domitian
on his poetry, and to Titus on his victories over the Jews.</p>

<p class='c011'>He evidently did not live to complete his original design:
even the eighth book is unfinished; and, from the events still
remaining to be related, he probably planned an epic poem of
the same length as that of Virgil, whose style and versification
he endeavoured to imitate. An Italian poet, John Baptista
Pius, continued the subject, by an addition to the eighth book,
and by subjoining two more, the incidents of which were partly
borrowed from Apollonius.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>Of his merits Quintilian speaks favourably in the passage
already alluded to, and says, that in him literature had sustained
a severe loss. The severer criticism of Scaliger is more precise
and more judicious:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Immaturâ morte præreptus acerbum
item poëma suum nobis reliquit. Est autem omnino duriusculus,
penitus vero nudus Gratiarum comitate.</span>” The defects of the
Argonautica are, in fact, rather of a negative than a positive
character. There are no glaring faults or blemishes; none of
the affectation or rhetorical artifices which belong to the period
of the decline. There may be a little occasional hardness, and
a few awkward expressions and paraphrases, but there is no
bombast to outrage good taste, and no unmetrical cadences to
offend the ear. But there is no genius, no inspiration, no thrilling
fervour, no thoughts that breathe or words that burn. He
never rises above a dead level. Every thing is in accordance
with decent and direct propriety. He has some talent as a descriptive
poet: his versification is harmonious, and he attains to
those superficial excellencies which are found in the prize poem
of a pains-taking, ingenious, and well-educated scholar. Virgil
was an imitator: that is, his taste, like Roman taste, universally
was formed and trained by imitation; but his spirit disdained
these trammels, and soared to originality. V. Flaccus
is scarcely ever original except when he is commonplace: he
imitates Virgil successfully, as far as the outward graces of style
are concerned; but in the charm of natural simplicity, he always
falls short of his great original.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>P. Papinius Statius</span> (<span class='fss'>BORN A. D.</span> 61.)</h4>

<p class='c018'>Towards the middle of the first century of the Christian era,<a id='r1118' /><a href='#f1118' class='c012'><sup>[1118]</sup></a>
there arrived at Rome, from Naples, a grammarian, named P.
Papinius Statius. He opened a school, and soon became so celebrated
as a public instructor, that he became tutor to the young
Domitian, whose favour and affection continued after he became
emperor. Some of his fame was also founded on gaining, in his
boyhood, the prize in many public contests of poetry. Every
year between the age of thirteen and nineteen, he is said to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>been crowned. These contests were partly of an improvisatorial
character; and in an age when public readings and recitations
were in vogue, and were the means which poets had of gaining
fame and patronage, success of this kind was highly valued.
The subject of one of his poems is said to have been the conflagration
of the Capitol, during the struggle between the Vitellians
and the supporters of Vespasian.<a id='r1119' /><a href='#f1119' class='c012'><sup>[1119]</sup></a> Statius, however,
seems to have possessed no higher degree of poetical power
than a happy facility in versification, for he died<a id='r1120' /><a href='#f1120' class='c012'><sup>[1120]</sup></a> and left no
works which have stood the test of time.</p>

<p class='c011'>A son, however, inherited poetical talents of the same kind,
but of a far higher order than those of his father, and although,
for a long time, he was entirely dependent upon his works for
the means of living, and, notwithstanding thunders of applause,
must starve, unless he can sell his play to the manager Paris,<a id='r1121' /><a href='#f1121' class='c012'><sup>[1121]</sup></a>
the sunshine of imperial favour, which his father had enjoyed,
shone upon him.<a id='r1122' /><a href='#f1122' class='c012'><sup>[1122]</sup></a> He purchased patronage, however, at the
expense of grossly flattering the tyrant. This son, who bore
the same name as his father, was the author of the Silvæ, Thebaid,
and Achilleid. He was born <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 61, and died in the
prime of life, <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 95, at Naples, his native city. As no interesting
particulars are recorded respecting his life, and as he is
never mentioned by any classical author except Juvenal,<a id='r1123' /><a href='#f1123' class='c012'><sup>[1123]</sup></a> it is
impossible to say how the opinion arose which was entertained
by his admirer Dante, and others, that he was in secret a defender
of the Christians, and also himself a believer.<a id='r1124' /><a href='#f1124' class='c012'><sup>[1124]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>He was a true Italian in the character of his genius. He had
a thorough perception of the beauties of nature. His Silvæ are
full of truthful pictures. He possessed ready facility in versification,
which was surpassed by no poet of classic antiquity except
Ovid, and that improvisatorial power for which his countrymen
in the present day are so often celebrated. As long as he
was content to be a poet on a small scale he was eminently successful.
His Sylvæ contain many poetical incidents which might
stand by themselves as perfect fugitive pieces,—brief effusions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>suggested by statues<a id='r1125' /><a href='#f1125' class='c012'><sup>[1125]</sup></a> and buildings,<a id='r1126' /><a href='#f1126' class='c012'><sup>[1126]</sup></a> verses of compliment<a id='r1127' /><a href='#f1127' class='c012'><sup>[1127]</sup></a> and
delicate flattery,<a id='r1128' /><a href='#f1128' class='c012'><sup>[1128]</sup></a> or condolence<a id='r1129' /><a href='#f1129' class='c012'><sup>[1129]</sup></a> or congratulation. It matters
not how light or trifling the subject, he can raise it and adorn it.
He writes with equal beauty on the tree of his friend Atedius;<a id='r1130' /><a href='#f1130' class='c012'><sup>[1130]</sup></a>
the death of a parrot; of the emperor’s lion;<a id='r1131' /><a href='#f1131' class='c012'><sup>[1131]</sup></a> the locks of
Flavius Earinus;<a id='r1132' /><a href='#f1132' class='c012'><sup>[1132]</sup></a> the rude freedom of the Saturnalia.<a id='r1133' /><a href='#f1133' class='c012'><sup>[1133]</sup></a> It is
in these unpretending poems that we see his natural and unaffected
elegance, his harmonious ear, and his truthfulness of perception.
But the case is totally different when the subject is
above him.<a id='r1134' /><a href='#f1134' class='c012'><sup>[1134]</sup></a> He had neither grasp of mind, nor vigour of imagination,
to fit him for the task of an epic poet; and, hence, his
great work, the Thebaid, and his other unfinished epic, the
Achilleid, are complete failures.</p>

<p class='c011'>In his minor poems he seems to trust to the natural powers of
his genius; he never strains at producing effect, nor is he too
solicitous about exact finish and laborious polish. Although not
improvisatorial, they partake of that character, and have all its
freshness combined with the advantage of written and corrected
performances. His thoughts are inspired by his subject; and its
reality, which he was capable of appreciating, gives a life to
his compositions. But the principal fault in his Silvæ is too
great a display of Greek learning. Every page is full of mythological
allusions, which sometimes render his graceful verses
dry and wearisome, and must have rendered them acceptable to
those only who were well versed in Greek literature: they never
could have been universally popular. The qualities which recommended
his Silvæ do not adorn his epic poetry. His imaginary
heroes do not inspire and warm his imagination: he is not
affected by their personality in the same way in which he is by
the lawns and groves, and sun, and forests, and skies of Italy.</p>

<p class='c011'>For this deficiency he attempts to compensate by extravagant
bombast, totally out of keeping with the action of the poem, and
by an attention to the theoretical principles of art, and an elaborate
finish which must have cost him many hours of toil. Yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>this perseverance is thrown away, and the effect produced by
the contrast between the action and essence of the poem, and the
language in which it is externally clothed, produces an effect
contrary to that which was intended.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was a skilful draughtsman, a gorgeous colourist, a pleasing
landscape-painter, and a diligent student of the rules of art;
but his genius could not rise to the highest departments of art—he
could not give the mind or the <i>morale</i> to those characters
whose external features he was so apt in delineating. He owes
the estimation in which he is held as an epic poet not to his absolute
but his relative merit. He was the best of the heroic
poets of his day. Statius, notwithstanding his defects, was evidently
a profound student as well as an admirer of the Homeric
poems; and there are two points in which he has proved himself
a successful imitator. These are his battles and his similes.
His descriptions of the former are stirring and dramatic, and
some of his similes will bear comparison with the best Latin specimens
of this kind of illustration. When it is remembered that
no epic poet has approached more nearly to Homer in the use of
the simile than Dante, and that he equals the Greek bard in
sublime and picturesque description, it may easily be imagined
that these were the qualities in the poems of Statius which especially
called forth his admiration.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few words only are necessary to describe the nature and
subject-matter of the poems of Statius. The Silvæ consist of
thirty-two separate pieces. They are all hexametrical, with the
exception of four in hendecasyllabics,<a id='r1135' /><a href='#f1135' class='c012'><sup>[1135]</sup></a> one in Alcaic,<a id='r1136' /><a href='#f1136' class='c012'><sup>[1136]</sup></a> and one
in Sapphic metre.<a id='r1137' /><a href='#f1137' class='c012'><sup>[1137]</sup></a> Each of the five books in which these poems
are arranged has a prose dedication to some friend prefixed;
the first being addressed to the poet Stella, the common friend
of himself and Martial.<a id='r1138' /><a href='#f1138' class='c012'><sup>[1138]</sup></a> The title Silvæ was given to these
poems, on account of the very quality which constitutes their
especial charm. They are the rude materials of thought, springing
up spontaneously in all their wild luxuriance from the rich
natural soil of the poet’s imagination, unpruned, untrimmed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>ignorant of that cultivated art which an affected and artificial
age thought necessary to constitute a finished poem. “Such
extemporaneous performances as these,” says Quintilian, “are
called Silvæ: the author subsequently re-examines and corrects
his effusions.”<a id='r1139' /><a href='#f1139' class='c012'><sup>[1139]</sup></a> The Thebaid is comprised in twelve books, and
its subject is the ancient Greek legends respecting the war of
the Seven against Thebes. The composition of this work preceded
the publication of the Silvæ. Achilleid was intended,
doubtless, to embrace all the exploits of Achilles, but only two
books were completed.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Domitian.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>A paraphrase of the Phænomena of Aratus belongs to this age.
It has been ascribed to Germanicus, but its real author was Domitian,
who, as well as Nero, wrote verses.<a id='r1140' /><a href='#f1140' class='c012'><sup>[1140]</sup></a> As far as language
and versification are concerned, it is not without merit; but the
subject is unsuitable to poetry.<a id='r1141' /><a href='#f1141' class='c012'><sup>[1141]</sup></a> Domitian had taste, although
his talents did not deserve the adulatory commendations of
Quintilian;<a id='r1142' /><a href='#f1142' class='c012'><sup>[1142]</sup></a> but he encouraged learned men: and to his encouragement
we owe those distinguished contemporary writers who,
for one generation, arrested the downward progress of Roman
literature.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Epigram.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The Greek Epigram was originally, as the word implies, simply
an inscription. It was therefore short and concise; its metre
elegiac, as especially suited to the periodic structure of the sentiment,
and its characteristic qualities, terseness and neatness.
So long as it retained this character it was free from bitterness;
and the principal element of success in this species of composition
was tact rather than genius, and a cultivated taste rather
than poetical inspiration. Not only were Catullus, Virgil, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>Ovid epigrammatists, but some Roman <i>literati</i>, arrived at mediocrity,
or even excellence, in epigram, who were not capable of becoming
great poets. Julius Cæsar wrote one on Terence, and
perhaps the following neatly-turned lines; although they have
been ascribed to Augustus and Germanicus:—</p>

<p class='c011'>To the original characteristics of epigram the Romans added
that which constitutes an epigram in the modern sense of the
term, pointedness either in jest or earnest, and the bitterness of
personal satire. Common sense, shrewdness, and an acute observation
of human nature were thus superadded to Greek gracefulness
and elegance; and the same nation which reduced the wild
and unpremeditated sarcasms of the Greek stage into the symmetrical
form of satire, produced also the epigram as written
by the pen of Martial. The same characteristics of the Roman
mind which mark satire are visible also in epigram. Epigram
is the concentration of satire. The desultory vagueness which
is allowable in the latter, the variety of subjects, which are
touched upon with irregular and unrestrained freedom, are, in
the former, limited and defined. One idea is selected, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>this all the powers of the writer’s acute mind are directed, and
made to converge as to a point. It is not often that the harmless
elements of Greek wit, such as the pun, or the pleasantry
by surprise or unexpected turn (although these sometimes
occur,<a id='r1145' /><a href='#f1145' class='c012'><sup>[1145]</sup></a>) are found in the Roman epigram. Smartness is generally
connected with severity. The same bitter spirit which
dictated the Archilochian epodes of Horace, which breathes
throughout the indignant lines of Juvenal, points the shafts of
Martial. The blows, however, which he aimed at vice could
not be deadly, because he had no faith in virtue, and because he
delighted to grovel in the impurity which he described.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>M. Valerius Martialis</span> (<span class='fss'>BORN A. D.</span> 43.)</h4>

<p class='c018'>All that is known of the life of Martial is derived from his
own works; and this is but little, for he says nothing of his early
years, and did not begin to write until the reign of Domitian.
Of his parents he undutifully tells us that they were fools for
teaching him to read.<a id='r1146' /><a href='#f1146' class='c012'><sup>[1146]</sup></a> He was born at Bilbilis, a Spanish town
in the province of Tarragon,<a id='r1147' /><a href='#f1147' class='c012'><sup>[1147]</sup></a> of the position of which nothing
is known for certain, except that its site was an elevated one,<a id='r1148' /><a href='#f1148' class='c012'><sup>[1148]</sup></a>
overlooking the river Salo, which flowed round its walls. It
appears to have prided itself on its manufactures in gold and
iron;<a id='r1149' /><a href='#f1149' class='c012'><sup>[1149]</sup></a> to have been particularly famous for its arms;<a id='r1150' /><a href='#f1150' class='c012'><sup>[1150]</sup></a> and to
have been one of the Roman colonies dignified with the title of
Augusta.<a id='r1151' /><a href='#f1151' class='c012'><sup>[1151]</sup></a> As Vespasian had conferred on the poet’s native
town, in common with the rest of Spain, the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus Latii</span></i>,<a id='r1152' /><a href='#f1152' class='c012'><sup>[1152]</sup></a> Martial
was by birth a Roman citizen; and in the days of his popularity
obtained this privilege for many of his friends.<a id='r1153' /><a href='#f1153' class='c012'><sup>[1153]</sup></a> His birthday
was March 1,<a id='r1154' /><a href='#f1154' class='c012'><sup>[1154]</sup></a> <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 43, the third year of the reign of Claudius.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the twenty-second year of his age, the twelfth year of the
reign of Nero,<a id='r1155' /><a href='#f1155' class='c012'><sup>[1155]</sup></a> he migrated to Rome. He was a great favourite
of Titus and Domitian, by whom the “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus trium liberorum</span></i>” was
conferred upon him,<a id='r1156' /><a href='#f1156' class='c012'><sup>[1156]</sup></a> together with the rank of a Roman knight,<a id='r1157' /><a href='#f1157' class='c012'><sup>[1157]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>and the honorary title of tribune.<a id='r1158' /><a href='#f1158' class='c012'><sup>[1158]</sup></a> In the reign of the latter
he was appointed to the office of court poet, and received a pension
from the imperial treasury.<a id='r1159' /><a href='#f1159' class='c012'><sup>[1159]</sup></a> Hence during the latter part
of his residence in Rome it is almost certain that, although not
rich, he enjoyed a competency. He had a house in the city, and
a little villa at Nomentum given him by Domitian.<a id='r1160' /><a href='#f1160' class='c012'><sup>[1160]</sup></a> Nevertheless,
he is constantly complaining of his poverty, and thinks that
every one grows rich but himself. He laments that poets receive
nothing but compliments for their verses, whilst lawyers, and
even common criers, gain an ample maintenance:—that “Minerva
was a better patron than Apollo; a fuller stream of wealth flowed
through the Forum than from the fountain of Helicon, or the
channel of Permessus.”<a id='r1161' /><a href='#f1161' class='c012'><sup>[1161]</sup></a> He complains that he spends all he
has, and either borrows money from his friends, or takes to
another the presents he has given him, and querulously asks him
to purchase them back again.<a id='r1162' /><a href='#f1162' class='c012'><sup>[1162]</sup></a> The roof of his villa lets in the
rain; and when his friend Stella sends him some tiles to mend
it he reproaches him for not sending also a toga to protect the
poor inmate.<a id='r1163' /><a href='#f1163' class='c012'><sup>[1163]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>All this may have proceeded from the discontented feelings
which poets and literary men so often indulge at seeing genius
unrewarded, and affluence attending talents which, although if
not so high an order, are of more general utility. Perhaps, too,
though not absolutely poor, he was straitened in his circumstances,
considering his social position and the demands which this
entailed upon him. During thirty-five years he lived at Rome
the life of a flatterer, and a dependant,<a id='r1164' /><a href='#f1164' class='c012'><sup>[1164]</sup></a> and then returned to
his native town.<a id='r1165' /><a href='#f1165' class='c012'><sup>[1165]</sup></a> As Horace, when in his quiet country retirement,
sometimes regrets the enjoyments of the capital, although
when at Rome he sighs for the pleasures of rural life, so Martial,
when at Rome, longed for Bilbilis, and when he returned to
Bilbilis regretted Rome. At this late period of his life he married
a Spanish lady, named Marcella, whose property was amply
sufficient to maintain him in affluence. Her estate he considers
a little kingdom; her gardens he would not exchange for those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>of Alcinous; he praises her bowers, groves, fountains, streamlets,
fish-ponds, and meadows; and tells us the climate is so genial
that the olive-grounds are green in January, and the roses
blow twice in the year, like those of Pæstum.<a id='r1166' /><a href='#f1166' class='c012'><sup>[1166]</sup></a> His wife he
praises for her rare genius and sweet manners; he tells her that
no one could discover her provincial origin; that her equal could
not be found amongst the most elegant ladies in the capital; and
when inclined to forget Rome she alone is all that Rome ever
was to him:—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Tu desiderium dominæ mihi mitius urbis</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Esse jubes; Romam tu mihi sola facis.<a id='r1167' /><a href='#f1167' class='c012'><sup>[1167]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>But, notwithstanding the delicate compliment which he pays
to his rich wife—a compliment dictated probably more by his
habit of courtly flattery than by sincerity of affection—he evidently
pined for Rome. He was fitted for crowds and not for
solitude: his spirit was not pure enough to commune with itself.
His delight had been so long to study the human heart in its
worst developments, to drag forth to public view its blackest
plague-spots, that he would miss the foul models which he had
so long studied. Provincial life was therefore utter dulness to
him; his only enjoyment was to reproduce the results of his
observations on the life of the capital. Combining in himself
the apparently inconsistent characters of the flatterer and the
satirist, he needed great men to whom he might look up for
patronage and approbation, as well as moral wounds to probe
and subjects to anatomize. Rome alone supplied these; and
when he lost them he lost the intellectual food necessary for his
existence. The absence of his accustomed pursuits, and the
irremediable void thus created, is evident in many of his epigrams.</p>

<p class='c011'>The time of his death is uncertain, as the date of Pliny’s elegant
epistle to Priscus, in which it is mentioned, cannot be determined.<a id='r1168' /><a href='#f1168' class='c012'><sup>[1168]</sup></a>
But as it is probable that the eleventh book of his
Epigrams was published in the year in which he left Rome for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>Bilbilis, and as he apologizes in the dedication of his twelfth
book to Priscus for his obstinate indolence during a period of
three years, his death cannot have taken place before <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 104.
It is, however, generally supposed that his life was not prolonged
much beyond this date. His death may have been hastened by
his distaste for a provincial life, and by the malice and envy of
his new neighbours.<a id='r1169' /><a href='#f1169' class='c012'><sup>[1169]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>According to his own account, in an epigram,<a id='r1170' /><a href='#f1170' class='c012'><sup>[1170]</sup></a> in which he
contrasts himself with an effeminate fop, his appearance was
rough and unpolished, his shaggy hair refused to curl, his cheeks
were well-whiskered, and his voice was louder than the roar of
a lioness.<a id='r1171' /><a href='#f1171' class='c012'><sup>[1171]</sup></a> It is impossible to believe the assertion which he
makes respecting his own moral character, namely, that although
his verses are licentious his life was virtuous,</p>

<div class='c016'>

<div class='lg-container-b c006'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c022'>—although, measured by the corrupt standard of morals which
disgraced the age in which he lived, he was probably not worse
than most of his contemporaries. The fearful profligacy which
his powerful pen describes in such hideous terms spread through
Rome its loathsome infection. As no language is strong enough
to denounce the impurities of his age—impurities, in the description
of which, the poet evidently revels with a cynical delight—so
they were not merely creatures of a prurient imagination,
but had a real existence.</p>

<p class='c011'>It may be said in extenuation of his crime, that the prevalence
of vice produced the obscenity of the poet; but no more can be
said in defence of works in which the characters of vice are
emblazoned in such shameless and unnatural deformity. Had
he lived in better times, his talents, of which no doubt can be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>entertained, might have been devoted to a purer object; as it
was, his moral taste must have been thoroughly depraved not
to have turned with loathing and disgust from the contemplation
of such subjects, instead of voluntarily seeking them; for “out
of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.” In Martial
we observe that paradoxical but still not unusual combination
of varied wit, poetical imagination, and a happy power of graceful
expression, not only with strong sensual passions, but with a
delight in vice in its most hateful forms and attributes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although the new feature which Martial added to the Greek
epigram is such as has been described, and although his pages
are polluted and defiled, not all his poems are spiteful or obscene.
Amidst some obscurity of style and want of finish, many are redolent
of Greek sweetness and elegance. Here and there are
pleasing descriptions of the beauties of nature;<a id='r1173' /><a href='#f1173' class='c012'><sup>[1173]</sup></a> and, setting aside
those which are evidently dictated by the spirit of flattery, many
are kind-hearted, as well as complimentary. The few lines which
were intended to accompany such trifling offerings of friendship
as the poet could afford to give, and which, doubtless, rendered
a flower or a toy doubly acceptable, are equal in neatness to many
of the Greek Anthology. When he sends a rose to Apollinaris,
it is accompanied by the following elegant lines:—</p>

<div class='c016'>

<p class='c021'>Go, happy rose, and with thy delicate garlands wreathe the locks of
my Apollinaris; and remember, so may Venus ever love thee! to entwine

</div>

<p class='c011'>The fourteenth book contains numerous ingenious couplets,
sent, together with pencases, dice, tablets, toothpicks, and other
little presents, at the Saturnalian festival.</p>

<p class='c011'>In so vast a collection of pieces it is natural to expect that
there would be great inequality, and that some of his wit would
be commonplace and puerile. That such was the case, he himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>confesses more than once;<a id='r1175' /><a href='#f1175' class='c012'><sup>[1175]</sup></a> and in one place he states that
this inequality constitutes one of the merits of his work.<a id='r1176' /><a href='#f1176' class='c012'><sup>[1176]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>He knew that his works were appreciated, not only at Rome,

shows itself,<a id='r1178' /><a href='#f1178' class='c012'><sup>[1178]</sup></a> and which does not hesitate to account

</div>

<p class='c010'>The earliest prose writers belonging to this epoch were Aufidius
Bassus and Cremutius Cordus. The former wrote a history
of the German and civil wars, which was continued by the elder
Pliny; of the latter only a few fragments have been preserved
by Seneca.<a id='r1180' /><a href='#f1180' class='c012'><sup>[1180]</sup></a> They were published in the reign of Tiberius;
and it is evident that they contained a history of the civil wars,
for his praise of Brutus and Cassius was made the pretext for
his impeachment. It is also clear that he treated of contemporary
events; for the real cause of the emperor’s hostility was an
attack which he made upon the favourite Sejanus. In vain he
tendered an apology; and seeing there was no hope of escape he
starved himself to death.<a id='r1181' /><a href='#f1181' class='c012'><sup>[1181]</sup></a> His histories were publicly burned,
but his daughter, to whom Seneca addressed his “<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Consolatio</span></cite>,”
concealed some copies, and afterwards published them, with the
approbation of Caligula.<a id='r1182' /><a href='#f1182' class='c012'><sup>[1182]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>M. Velleius Paterculus.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Together with these flourished M. Velleius Paterculus. He
was a soldier of equestrian family, served his first campaign in
Asia, and subsequently, after passing through the various steps
of promotion, acted as <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">legatus</span></i> to Tiberius in Germany. His
services recommended him to the favour of the prince, on whose
accession he was made prætor, and proved himself a stanch
supporter of him and his favourite minister Sejanus. In the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>fall of that unworthy man,<a id='r1183' /><a href='#f1183' class='c012'><sup>[1183]</sup></a> Paterculus was involved, and was
most probably put to death.</p>

<p class='c011'>The short historical work by which he is known as an author
is a history of Rome, and of the nations connected with the
foundation of the imperial city, in two books. It is dedicated
to M. Vinucius, consul; and as it carries on the history to the
death of Livia, the mother of Tiberius, in the year of his consulate,<a id='r1184' /><a href='#f1184' class='c012'><sup>[1184]</sup></a>
it must have been finished, perhaps almost entirely
written within that year. Assuming that it was wise to undertake
the task of comprising within such narrow limits
events extending over so large a field, it is not unskilfully performed.
The most striking events are selected and told in a
lively and interesting manner; but he had one fault fatal to his
character as an historian, who professed to treat of his own
times. He is partial, prejudiced, and adulatory. He had not
courage to be a Thucydides or a Sallust. The perilous nature
of the times, and the personal obligations under which he was to
the emperor, made him a courtier, and from this one-sided point
of view he viewed contemporary history.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was, however, a man of lively talents though of superficial
education: his taste was formed after the model of the Augustan
writers, especially Sallust, of whose style, so far as the
outward form, he was an imitator. But although he was one of
the earliest writers of the so called silver age, his language
shows signs of degeneracy. It is, at times, overstrained and
unnatural; there is the usual affectation of rhetorical effect, and
an unnecessary use of uncommon words and constructions; still,
whenever he keeps his model in view, he is scarcely inferior to
him in conciseness and perspicuity. The first book of his history
is in a very imperfect state; in fact, the commencement is entirely
lost. Only one manuscript of it has been discovered, and
even this is now nowhere to be found.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Valerius Maximus.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Valerius Maximus can scarcely be termed an historian, although
the subject of which he treated is historical. His work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>is neither one of original research, nor is it a connected abridgment
of the investigation of his predecessors. It is a collection
of anecdotes, entitled <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dictorum Factorumque Memorabilium</span></cite>,
Libri <span class='fss'>IX.</span> His object is a moral one; namely, to illustrate, by
examples, the beauty of virtue and the deformity of vice; but
he is influenced in the selection less by historical truth than by
the striking and interesting character of the narrative. The
arrangement of the anecdotes resembles that of a commonplace
book, rather than of history, the only principle observed being,
that anecdotes of Romans and foreigners are kept distinct from
one another.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nothing is known, for certain, respecting his personal history.
He himself states<a id='r1185' /><a href='#f1185' class='c012'><sup>[1185]</sup></a> that he accompanied Sextus Pompeius into
Asia; and, from a comparison of different passages, it is probable
that, like Velleius Paterculus, he flourished and wrote during
the reign of Tiberius. His style is prolix and declamatory,
and characterized by awkward affectation and involved obscurity.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>C. Cornelius Tacitus.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>For the reasons already stated, Rome, for a long period, could
boast of no historian; but, under the genial and fostering influence
of the Emperor Trajan,<a id='r1186' /><a href='#f1186' class='c012'><sup>[1186]</sup></a> not only the fine arts, especially
architecture, flourished, but also literature revived. The choice
of Nerva could not have fallen on a better successor to his
short reign. He was a Spaniard, but his native town was a
flourishing Roman colony: the whole country round about it had
experienced the effects of Roman civilization, and the language
of all the towns in the south of Spain was Latin. The glories
of war and the duties of peace divided his attention. By the
former, he gave employment to his vast armies; by the latter he
refined the tastes and improved the character of his people.
No better testimony can be desired than the correspondence between
him and Pliny to the mildness and wisdom of his domestic
and foreign administration. The influence, also, of his empress,
Plotina, and his sister, Marciana, exercised a beneficial influence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>upon Roman society; for they were the first ladies of
the imperial court who by their example checked the shameless
licentiousness which had long prevailed amongst women of the
higher classes. The same taste and execution which are visible
in the bas-reliefs on the column of Trajan adorn the literature
of his age, as illustrated by its two great lights, Tacitus and
the younger Pliny. There is not the rich, graceful ornament
which invests with such a charm the writers of the golden age;
but the absence of these qualities is amply compensated by dignity,
gravity, honesty and truthfulness. There is a solidity in
the style of Tacitus which makes amends for its difficulty, and
justifies the intense admiration with which he was regarded by
Pliny. Truthfulness beams throughout the writings of these
two great contemporaries; and incorruptible virtue is as visible
in the pages of Tacitus as benevolence is in the letters of
Pliny. They mutually influenced each other’s character and
principles: their tastes and pursuits were similar: they loved
each other dearly; corresponded regularly, corrected each other’s
works, and accepted patiently and gratefully each other’s criticisms.
If, however, on all occasions, their observations were
such as appear in the letters of Pliny, it is probable that their
mutual regard, and the unbounded admiration which Pliny entertained
for the superior genius of his friend caused them to
be rather laudatory than severe.</p>

<p class='c011'>The exact date of the birth of Tacitus is not known; but
from one of the many letters extant, addressed to him by Pliny,<a id='r1187' /><a href='#f1187' class='c012'><sup>[1187]</sup></a>
it may be inferred that the former was not more than one or two
years senior to his friend. In it he reminds him that in years
they are almost equals, and adds that he himself was a young
man when Tacitus had already obtained a brilliant reputation.
There is a tradition which assigns the birth of Tacitus to the
year of Nero’s accession; but as Pliny the Younger was born <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span>
61, and Nero assumed the imperial purple <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 54, this date
would make the difference in age between him and Pliny too
great to be consistent with the expressions of the latter. Tacitus
was of equestrian rank, and was procurator of Belgic Gaul
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>in the reigns of Vespasian and Titus, from whom, as well as
from Domitian, he received many marks of esteem. In <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 78,
he married the daughter of C. Julius Agricola. He was one of
the fifteen commissioners appointed for the celebration of the
Ludi Seculares, <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 88, and was also prætor the same year. In
<span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 97, he served the office of consul. To this magistracy he
was elected in order to supply the place of Virginius Rufus,
who had died during his year of office, and over him Tacitus
pronounced the funeral oration. In <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 99, he was associated by
the Senate with Pliny<a id='r1188' /><a href='#f1188' class='c012'><sup>[1188]</sup></a> in the impeachment of Marius Priscus,
proconsul of Africa, for maladministration of his province; and
his friend Pliny praises his reply to the acute subtleties of Salvius
Liberalis, the advocate of Marius, as distinguished, not only
for oratorical power, but for that which he considers the most
remarkable quality of his style, <i>gravity</i>. His words are, “Respondit
Corn. Tacitus eloquentissime et quod eximie orationi
ejus inest, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σεμνως</span>.”<a id='r1189' /><a href='#f1189' class='c012'><sup>[1189]</sup></a> It is not known when Tacitus died, nor
whether he left any descendants; but there can be no doubt that
he survived the accession of Hadrian.<a id='r1190' /><a href='#f1190' class='c012'><sup>[1190]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The works of Tacitus which are extant, are:—(1.) A Life of
his father-in-law, Agricola. (2.) A tract on the Manners and
Nations of Germany. (3.) A small portion of a voluminous
work, entitled Histories. (4.) About two-thirds of another historical
work, entitled Annals. (5.) A dialogue on the Decline
of Eloquence is also ascribed to him; and although doubts have
been entertained of its genuineness, they do not rest upon any
strong foundation. It is impossible to do more than approximate
to the dates at which each work of Tacitus was composed.
The imminent peril of writing or speaking plainly on events or
individuals renders it almost certain that none of them could have
been published before the accession of Trajan. Niebuhr<a id='r1191' /><a href='#f1191' class='c012'><sup>[1191]</sup></a> entertains
no doubt that the first edition of the Life of Agricola was
published towards the end of Domitian’s reign, and that, subsequently,
it was revised and an introduction prefixed. But is it
not more probable that, although the work was then written, it
was not published until after revision?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>Great as were the moral worth and the amiable gentleness of
Agricola, his courage as a soldier, his skill and decision as a
general, his prudence and caution as a politician, and, therefore,
however deserving he may be of the pleasing light in which his
character is portrayed, still the life of Tacitus is a panegyric
rather than a biography. The near relation in which Tacitus
stood to him, the affectionate admiration which Agricola must
necessarily have commanded from one who knew him so well,
unfitted him for the work of an impartial biographer. The fine
points of Agricola’s character outshine all its other features; but
we cannot suppose that he had no defects, no weaknesses. These,
however, do not appear in the little work of Tacitus. His son-in-law
either could not or would not see them. Still the brief
sketch is a beautiful specimen of the vigour and force of expression
with which this greatest painter of antiquity could throw off
any portrait which he attempted. Even if the likeness be somewhat
flattered, the qualities which the writer possessed, his insight
into character, his pathetic power, and his affectionate
heart, render this short piece one of the most attractive biographies
extant.<a id='r1192' /><a href='#f1192' class='c012'><sup>[1192]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>With what simple pathos does he tell us of the obligation
which Agricola, like so many other great men, owed to the educating
care of his pure-minded, prudent, and indulgent mother,
and the gratitude with which he was wont constantly to speak
of that obligation! With what affection does he speak of one
bound to him, not only by the ties of affinity, but by the stronger
ties of a congenial temper and disposition! In his reflections on
his death, there is no affected attempt at dramatic display. The
few words devoted to so mournful a subject simply breathe the
overwhelming sense of bereavement, unassuaged by the consolation
of being present at his last moments. “Happy wert thou,
Agricola, not only because thy life was glorious, but because thy
death was well-timed! All who heard thy last words bear witness
to the constancy with which thou didst welcome death as
though thou wert determined manfully to acquit the emperor of
being the cause. But the bitterness of thy daughter’s sorrow and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>mine for the loss of a parent is enhanced by the reflection, that it
did not fall to our lot to watch over thy declining health, to solace
thy failing strength, to enjoy thy last looks, thy last embraces.
Faithfully would we have listened to thy parting words and
wishes, and imprinted them deeply on our memories. This was
our chief sorrow, our most painful wound. Owing to our long
absence from Rome, thou hadst been lost to us four years before.
Doubtless, O best of parents! enough, and more than enough, of
honour was paid to thee by the assiduous attention of thy affectionate
wife; still the last offices were paid thee amidst too few
tears, and thine eyes were conscious that some loved object was
absent just as their light was dimmed for ever.” To this tribute
of dutiful affection, succeed sentiments of noble resignation,
joined with an humble conviction of the transitory nature of human
talents, and an earnest looking-for of immortality. To us, the
biography of Agricola is especially interesting, because Britain
was the scene of his glory as a military commander, and of his
success in civil administration. His army first penetrated beyond
the Friths of Forth and Clyde into the Highlands of Scotland,
and his fleet first circumnavigated the northern extremities of
the British island.</p>

<p class='c011'>The treatise on the geography, manners and nations of Germany
(<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Situ Moribus et Populus Germaniæ</span></cite>) is but little longer
than the Life of Agricola. The information contained in it is
exactly of that character which might be expected, considering
the sources from which it was derived. Tacitus was never in
Germany, and therefore his knowledge was collected from those
who had visited it for the purposes either of war or commerce.
Hence his geographical descriptions are often vague and inaccurate;
a mixture of the marvellous shows that some of his narratives
consist in mere travellers’ tales, whilst the salient points
and characteristic features of the national manners bear the
impress of truth, and are supported by the well-known habits
and institutions of Teutonic nations.</p>

<p class='c011'>He tells of their bards, and explains the etymology of the
term by the word Barditum, which signified the recitation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>their songs.<a id='r1193' /><a href='#f1193' class='c012'><sup>[1193]</sup></a> He hints at wild legends and dark superstitions
with which the German imagination still loves to people the
dark recesses of their forests.<a id='r1194' /><a href='#f1194' class='c012'><sup>[1194]</sup></a> He describes their pure and unmixed
race, and, consequently, the universal prevalence of the
national features—blue eyes, red or sandy hair, and stalwart and
gigantic frames.<a id='r1195' /><a href='#f1195' class='c012'><sup>[1195]</sup></a> According to his account, their political constitutions
were elective monarchies, but the monarch was always
of noble birth and his power limited;<a id='r1196' /><a href='#f1196' class='c012'><sup>[1196]</sup></a> and all matters of importance
were debated by the estate of the people.<a id='r1197' /><a href='#f1197' class='c012'><sup>[1197]</sup></a> In the solemn

investiture with lance and shield, is seen the origin of knighthood;<a id='r1198' /><a href='#f1198' class='c012'><sup>[1198]</sup></a>
and in the sanctity of the marriage-tie, the chastity of
the female sex, their social influence, and the respect paid to
them—the rarity of adultery and its severe punishment, and the
total absence of polygamy—we recognise the germ of the distinguishing
characteristics of chivalry.<a id='r1199' /><a href='#f1199' class='c012'><sup>[1199]</sup></a> They were hospitable
and constant to their hereditary friendships, but stern in perpetuating
family feuds;<a id='r1200' /><a href='#f1200' class='c012'><sup>[1200]</sup></a> passionately fond of gambling, and strict
in their regard for debts of honour;<a id='r1201' /><a href='#f1201' class='c012'><sup>[1201]</sup></a> inveterate drinkers, and
their favourite potation was beer;<a id='r1202' /><a href='#f1202' class='c012'><sup>[1202]</sup></a> they could not consult on
important matters without a convivial meeting;<a id='r1203' /><a href='#f1203' class='c012'><sup>[1203]</sup></a> if they quarrelled
over their cups, they had recourse rarely to words,
usually to blows.<a id='r1204' /><a href='#f1204' class='c012'><sup>[1204]</sup></a> Their slaves were in the condition of serfs
or villains, and paid to the lord a fixed rent in corn, or cattle,
or manufactures.<a id='r1205' /><a href='#f1205' class='c012'><sup>[1205]</sup></a> They reckoned their time by nights instead
of days,<a id='r1206' /><a href='#f1206' class='c012'><sup>[1206]</sup></a> just as we are accustomed to use the expressions se’nnight
and fortnight.</p>

<p class='c011'>After having sketched the manners and customs of the nation
as a whole he proceeds to treat of each tribe separately.<a id='r1207' /><a href='#f1207' class='c012'><sup>[1207]</sup></a> In
speaking of our forefathers, the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Angli</span></i>, who inhabited part of
the modern territory of Sleswick Holstein, and whose name

uses is an English one. The Angli, he says, together with
the conterminous tribes, worship Herthus, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i> Terra.<a id='r1208' /><a href='#f1208' class='c012'><sup>[1208]</sup></a> Even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>in these early times he mentions the naval superiority of the
Suiones, who were the ancestors of the Normans and Sea-kings.
With these he affirms that the continent of Europe terminates,
and all beyond is a motionless and frozen ocean.<a id='r1209' /><a href='#f1209' class='c012'><sup>[1209]</sup></a> Truth in
these distant climes mingles with fable. Daylight continues
after the sun has set, but a hissing noise is heard as his blazing
orb plunges into the sea, and the forms of the gods, and the
radiant glories which surround their heads, are visible.<a id='r1210' /><a href='#f1210' class='c012'><sup>[1210]</sup></a> The
list of marvels ends with fabulous beings, whose bodies and
limbs are those of wild beasts, whilst their heads and faces are
human.</p>

<p class='c011'>The earliest historical work of Tacitus is his “<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Historiæ</span></cite>,” of
which only four books and a portion of the fifth are extant.
Their contents extend from the second consulship of Galba<a id='r1211' /><a href='#f1211' class='c012'><sup>[1211]</sup></a> to
the commencement of the siege of Jerusalem. The original
work concluded with the death of Domitian.<a id='r1212' /><a href='#f1212' class='c012'><sup>[1212]</sup></a> He purposed also,
if his life had been spared, to add the reigns of Nerva and Trajan,
as the employment of his old age. “The materials for which,”
he says, “are more plentiful and trustworthy, because of the
unusual felicity of an age in which men were allowed to think
as they pleased, and to give utterance to what they thought.”<a id='r1213' /><a href='#f1213' class='c012'><sup>[1213]</sup></a>
It is plain from the word Divus (the deified) being prefixed to
the name of Nerva, and not to that of Trajan, in the passage
above quoted, that this work was written after Trajan had put
on the imperial purple.<a id='r1214' /><a href='#f1214' class='c012'><sup>[1214]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>According to St. Jerome it originally consisted of thirty books;
and the minuteness with which each event is recorded in the
portion extant renders it highly probable that the original work
was as extensive as this assertion would imply. The object which
he proposed to himself was worthy of his penetrating mind, from
the searching gaze of which even the hypocrisy and dissimulation
of a Tiberius were powerless to veil the foul darkness of his
crafty nature. He intended “to investigate the political state
of the commonwealth, the feelings of its armies, the sentiments
of the provinces, the elements of its strength and weakness, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>causes and reasons for each phænomenon.”<a id='r1215' /><a href='#f1215' class='c012'><sup>[1215]</sup></a> The principal fault
which diminishes the value of his history as a record of events,
is his too great readiness to accept evidence unhesitatingly, and
to record popular rumours without taking sufficient pains to examine
into their truth. Still these blots are but few, scattered
over a vast field of faithful history. Perhaps the most lamentable
instance is presented in his incorrect account of the history,
constitution, and manners of the Jewish people. Wanting either
the opportunity or the inclination to consult the sacred books of
the nation, he mixes up vague traditions of their early history
with the fables of Pagan mythology; and, like the Greeks and
Romans, gives names to imaginary patriarchs, taken from localities
connected with their history.</p>

<p class='c011'>According to his account the Jews originally inhabited Crete,<a id='r1216' /><a href='#f1216' class='c012'><sup>[1216]</sup></a>
and from Mount Ida, in that Island, received the name of Idæi,
which afterwards became corrupted into Judæi. From Crete,
when Saturn was expelled by Jove, they took refuge in Egypt; and
thence under two leaders, Juda and Hierosolymus, again migrated
to the neighbouring country of Palestine. A second tradition
attributes to them an Assyrian origin; a third an Æthiopian;
a fourth asserts that they were descended from the Solymi
which Homer celebrated in his poems.<a id='r1217' /><a href='#f1217' class='c012'><sup>[1217]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The next tradition which he mentions approaches nearer to
the true one. Egypt being afflicted with a plague, the king
Bocchoris, by the advice of the oracle of Ammon, purged his
kingdom of them, and under the guidance of Moses they began
their wanderings. When they were dying on their way for
want of water, their leader followed a herd of wild asses, by
which he was led to a copious well of water. Thus was their
drought relieved; and, after journeying six days, they obtained
possession of the land in which they built their capital and
temple. Moses introduced new religious rites contrary to those
of other nations. He set up the image of an ass in the Holy
of Holies—a statement which afterwards Tacitus virtually contradicts
by saying that they allow no images in their temples,<a id='r1218' /><a href='#f1218' class='c012'><sup>[1218]</sup></a>
that they preferred taking up arms to admitting the statue of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>Caligula into the temple;<a id='r1219' /><a href='#f1219' class='c012'><sup>[1219]</sup></a> and that when Pompey took Jerusalem,<a id='r1220' /><a href='#f1220' class='c012'><sup>[1220]</sup></a>
he found no image of any deity, and the sanctuary empty.
He adds, that they sacrifice rams in order to show contempt to
Jupiter Ammon, and oxen, because, under that form, Apis was
worshipped by the Egyptians; that they abstain from pork in
remembrance of their having been afflicted with leprosy, to
which that animal is subject, and eat unleavened bread as a memorial
of their once having stolen food. On the seventh day,
which terminated their wanderings, they do no work, and in
like manner the seventh year they devote to idleness. This
Sabbath, some assert that they keep holy in honour of Saturn.
They believe in the immortality of the soul, and in future rewards
and punishments, and embalm their dead like the Egyptians.
Such are the various traditions respecting the Jews which Tacitus
incorporates in his Histories.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Annals, which were written subsequently to the Histories,
were so called, because each historical event is recorded in
historical order under the year to which it belongs.<a id='r1221' /><a href='#f1221' class='c012'><sup>[1221]</sup></a> They consist
of sixteen books; commence with the death of Augustus,<a id='r1222' /><a href='#f1222' class='c012'><sup>[1222]</sup></a>
and conclude with that of Nero.<a id='r1223' /><a href='#f1223' class='c012'><sup>[1223]</sup></a> The only portions extant are—the
first four books, part of the fifth, the sixth, part of the
eleventh, the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and the
commencement of the sixteenth book. The Annals are rather
histories of each successive emperor than of the Roman people;
but this is the necessary condition of narrating the fortunes of
a nation which now possessed only the bare name, and not the
reality of constitutional government. The state was now the
emperor; the end and object of the social system his security;
and every political event must therefore be treated in relation
to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>But a history of this kind in the hands of one who had such
skill in diving into the recesses of man’s heart, who could read
so shrewdly and delineate so vigorously human character, who
possessed as a writer such picturesque and dramatic power, becomes
the more interesting from its biographical nature, and its
philosophical importance as a moral rather than a political study.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>It is not, owing to circumstances over which the author had no
control, the history of a great nation, for the Romans, as a whole,
were no longer great. Neither does it paint the rise, progress
and development of constitutional freedom, for it had reached
its zenith, had declined, become paralyzed, and finally extinct.
But still there existed bright examples of heroism, and courage,
and self-devotion, truly Roman, and instances not less prominent
of corruption and degradation. Individuals stand out in bold
relief, eminent for the noblest virtues or blackened by the
basest crimes. These appear either singly or in groups upon
the stage: the emperor forms the principal figure; and the moral
sense of the reader is awakened to admire instances of patient
suffering and determined bravery, or abject slavery and
remorseless despotism.</p>

<p class='c011'>The object of Tacitus, therefore, was not, like that of the
great philosophical historian of Greece, to describe the growth
of political institutions, or the implacable animosities which
raged between opposite political principles—the struggles for
supremacy between a class and a whole people—but the influence
which the establishment of tyranny on the ruins of liberty
exercised for good or for evil in bringing out the character of
the individual. Rome, the imperial city, was the all-engrossing
subject of his predecessors; Romans were but subordinate and
accessary. Tacitus delineated the lives and deaths of individuals,
and showed the relation which they bore to the fortunes of their
country.</p>

<p class='c011'>It would have been impossible to have satisfied a people whose
taste had become more than ever rhetorical, without the introduction
of orations. Those of Tacitus are perfect specimens of
art; and probably, with the exception of Galgacus,<a id='r1224' /><a href='#f1224' class='c012'><sup>[1224]</sup></a> far more true
than those of other Roman historians. Still he made use of them,
not only to imbody traditional accounts of what had really been
said on each occasion, but to illustrate his own views of the character
of the speaker, and to convey his own political opinions.</p>

<p class='c011'>Full of sagacious observation and descriptive power, Tacitus
engages the most serious attention of the reader by the gravity
of his condensed and comprehensive style, as he does by the wisdom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>and dignity of his reflections. The purity and gravity of
his sentiments remind the reader even of Christian authors.</p>

<p class='c011'>Living amidst the influences of a corrupt age he was uncontaminated;
and by his virtue and integrity, his chastened political
liberality, commands our admiration as a man, whilst his love of
truth is reflected in his character as an historian. Although he
imitated, as well as approved, the cautious policy of his father-in-law,
he was not destitute of moral firmness.</p>

<p class='c011'>It derogates nothing from his courage that he was silent during
the perilous times in which great part of his life was passed,
and spoke with boldness only when the happy reign of Nerva
had commenced, and the broken spirit of the nation had revived.
Like the rest of his fellow-countrymen he exhibited a remarkable
example of patient endurance, when the imperial jealousy made
even the praise of those who were obnoxious to the tyrant treason;
when it was considered a capital crime for Arulenus Rusticus
to praise Pætus Thrasea, and Herennius Senecio to eulogize
Priscus Helvidius.</p>

<p class='c011'>In those fearful times he himself says, that “as old Rome had
witnessed the greatest glories of liberty, so her descendants had
been cast down to the lowest depths of slavery; and would have
been deprived of the use of memory, as well as of language, if
it were equally in man’s power to forget as to be silent.”<a id='r1225' /><a href='#f1225' class='c012'><sup>[1225]</sup></a> In
such times prudence was a duty, and daring courage would have
been unavailing rashness. In his praise of Agricola, and his
blame of Pætus, he enunciates the principles which regulate
his own conduct—that to endanger yourself without the slightest
prospect of benefiting your country is mere ostentatious ambition.
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sciant</span>,” he writes, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quibus moris illicita mirari, posse
etiam sub malis principibus magnos viros esse; obsequiumque ac
modestiam, si industria ac vigor adsint, eo laudis excedere quo
plerique per abrupta, sed in nullum reipublicæ usum ambitiosa
morte inclaruerunt</span>.”<a id='r1226' /><a href='#f1226' class='c012'><sup>[1226]</sup></a> Again, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Thrasea Pætus sibi causam periculi
fecit, cæteris libertatis initium non præbuit</span>.”<a id='r1227' /><a href='#f1227' class='c012'><sup>[1227]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>In the style of Tacitus the form is always subordinate to the
matter; the ideas maintain their due supremacy over the language
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>in which they are conveyed. There is none of that striving
after epigrammatic terseness which savours of affectation.
His brevity, like that which characterizes the style of
Thucydides, is the necessary condensation of a writer whose
thoughts flow more quickly than his pen can express them.
Hence his sentences are suggestive of far more than they express:
they are enigmatical hints of deep and hidden meaning,
which keep the mind active and the attention alive, and delight
the reader with the pleasures of discovery and the consciousness
of difficulties overcome. Nor is this natural and unintentional
brevity unsuitable to the cautious reserve with which all were
tutored to speak and think of political subjects in perilous times.
It is extraordinary how often a similarity between his mind and
that of Thucydides inadvertently discovers itself—not only in
his mode of thinking, but also in his language, even in his grammatical
constructions, especially in his frequent substitution of
attraction for government, in instances of condensed construction,
and in the connexion of clauses grammatically different, although
they are metaphysically the same.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nor is his brevity dry or harsh—it is enlivened by copiousness,
variety, and poetry. He scarcely ever repeats the same idea in
the same form. No author is richer in synonymous words, or arranges
with more varied skill the position of words in a sentence.
As for poetic genius, his language is highly figurative; no
prose writer deals more largely in prosopopœia: his descriptions
of scenery and incidents are eminently picturesque; his characters
dramatic; the expression of his own sentiments and feelings
as subjective as lyric poetry.</p>

</div>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>C. Suetonius Tranquillus.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>C. Suetonius Tranquillus<a id='r1228' /><a href='#f1228' class='c012'><sup>[1228]</sup></a> was the son of Suetonius Lenis, who
served as<a id='t469'></a> tribunus angusticlavus of the thirteenth legion at the
battle of Bedriacum, in which the Emperor Otho was defeated
by Vitellius. The time of his birth is uncertain; but from a
passage at the end of his Life of Nero<a id='r1229' /><a href='#f1229' class='c012'><sup>[1229]</sup></a> it may be inferred that
he was born very soon after the death of that emperor, which
took place <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 68; for in it he mentions that, when twenty
years subsequent to Nero’s death, a false Nero appeared, he was
just arriving at manhood (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">adolescens</span></i>.) The knowledge of language
and rhetorical taste displayed in the remains of his works
on these subjects prove that he was well instructed in these
branches of a Roman liberal education: and a letter of the
younger Pliny,<a id='r1230' /><a href='#f1230' class='c012'><sup>[1230]</sup></a> whose intimate friend he was, speaks of him as
an advocate by profession. This letter represents him as unwilling
to plead a cause, which he had undertaken, because he was
frightened by a dream. It is probable that this anecdote is an
authentic one, because so many examples occur in his memoirs
of his superstitious belief in dreams, omens, ghosts, and prodigies.<a id='r1231' /><a href='#f1231' class='c012'><sup>[1231]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The affectionate regard which Pliny entertained for his friend
was very great, and led him to form too high an estimate of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>talents as a writer and an historian. On one occasion he used
his influence at court to get him a tribuneship; which, however,
he did not accept.<a id='r1232' /><a href='#f1232' class='c012'><sup>[1232]</sup></a> On another he obtained for him, from
Trajan,<a id='r1233' /><a href='#f1233' class='c012'><sup>[1233]</sup></a> the “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus trium liberorum</span></i>,” although he had no children.
But this privilege, as in the case of Martial, was sometimes
granted under similar circumstances. In this letter, which he
wrote to the Emperor, he speaks of Suetonius as a man of the
greatest probity, integrity, and learning; and adds that, after
the experience of a long acquaintance, the more he knows of him
the more he loves him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Subsequently Suetonius became private secretary (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magister
Epistolarum</span></i>) to Hadrian,<a id='r1234' /><a href='#f1234' class='c012'><sup>[1234]</sup></a> but was deprived of the situation.
Owing to the only sources of information respecting Suetonius
being his own works, and the few scattered notices in the letters
of Plinius Secundus, nothing more is known respecting his
life.</p>

<p class='c011'>A catalogue of his numerous writings is given by Suidas:<a id='r1235' /><a href='#f1235' class='c012'><sup>[1235]</sup></a>
but, with the exception of the Lives of the Twelve Cæsars, it
does not contain his chief extant works. These are notices of
illustrious grammarians and rhetoricians, and the lives of the
poets Terence, Horace, Persius, Lucan, and Juvenal.</p>

<p class='c011'>Niebuhr<a id='r1236' /><a href='#f1236' class='c012'><sup>[1236]</sup></a> believed that the history, or rather the biography
of the Cæsars was written when Suetonius was still young, before
he was secretary to Hadrian, and previous to the publication
of the Histories of Tacitus. If so, he neither enjoyed the
opportunities of consulting the imperial records which his situation
at court would have given him, nor of profiting by the accurate
guidance and profound reflection of Tacitus. Krause,<a id='r1237' /><a href='#f1237' class='c012'><sup>[1237]</sup></a>
on the other hand, adduces many parallelisms between the language
of Tacitus and Suetonius; and as Tacitus did not publish
his earliest historical work before <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 117,<a id='r1238' /><a href='#f1238' class='c012'><sup>[1238]</sup></a> assumes that Suetonius
did not write his biographies until after the accession of
Hadrian.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is very difficult to determine which of these theories is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>correct one; but there can be no doubt that the sources from
which he derived his information are quite independent of the
authority of Tacitus; and that the Lives of the Twelve Cæsars
would have contained all that we find in them, even if the Annals
and Histories had never been written. He does not only trust
to the works of the Roman historians, but his exact quotations
from acts of the senate and people, edicts, fasti, and orations,
and the use which he makes of annals and inscriptions, prove that
he was a man of diligent research, and that he examined original
documents for himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again, as a writer of biographical memoirs rather than of regular
history, and fond of anecdote and scandal, he availed himself
largely of such private letters of Emperors and their dependants
as fell in his way, of testamentary documents, and of the
information he could collect in conversation. Many of the lives
which he wrote were those of his contemporaries. Some of the
events recorded were passing under the eyes of the public, and
were matters of notoriety. He himself asserts in three several
places<a id='r1239' /><a href='#f1239' class='c012'><sup>[1239]</sup></a> that he received some of the accounts which he gives
from the testimony of eye-witnesses. The more secret habits of
the Emperors, either truly told or exaggerated by an appetite
for scandal, would ooze out. Anecdotes of the reigning Emperor’s
private life would be eagerly sought for, and be the favourite
topic of gossip in all circles of Roman society. Nor
would he have any difficulty in procuring copious stores of information
respecting those Emperors who reigned before he was
born from those of his contemporaries who were a generation
older than himself, and who were spectators of, or actors in,
many of the scenes which he describes. As a biographer, there
is no reason to doubt his honesty and veracity; he is industrious
and careful; he indulges neither in ornament of style nor in romantic
exaggeration; the picture which he draws is a terrible
one, but it is fully supported by the contemporary authority of
Juvenal and Tacitus. Nevertheless, his mind was not of that
comprehensive and philosophical character which would qualify
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>him for taking an enlarged view of political affairs, or for the
work of an historian. He has no definite plan formed in his
mind, without which an historian can never hope to make his
work a complete whole; he wanders at will from one subject to
another, just as the idea seizes him, and is by no means careful
of committing offences against chronological order.</p>

<p class='c011'>Niebuhr accuses him of inconsistency in the character which
he draws and the praise which he bestows on Vespasian:<a id='r1240' /><a href='#f1240' class='c012'><sup>[1240]</sup></a> but
adds what may, in some sort, be considered a defence, namely,
that Vespasian was, negatively speaking, a good, upright, and
just man, and that the dark side of his character must be considered
in reference to the fearful times in which he reigned.
He also mentions, as an example of his deficiencies as an historian,
the bad accounts which he has left of his own times,
especially of the anarchy which followed Nero’s death, and the
commencement of the reign of Vespasian. But in his praise it
may be said that Suetonius has formed a just estimate of his own
powers in undertaking to be a biographer and not an historian;
and it is scarcely fair to criticise severely his unfitness for a task
to which he made no pretensions.</p>

<p class='c011'>One great fault pollutes his pages. The dark pictures which
he draws of the most profligate Emperors, the disgusting annals
of their unheard-of crimes, are dwelt upon as though he took
pleasure in the description, and loved to wallow in the mire of
the foulest debauchery. Truth, perhaps, required that they
should not have been passed over in silence, but they might have
been lightly touched, and not painted in detail with revolting
faithfulness. He is often brief, sometimes obscure: in such passages
of his narrative we would have gladly welcomed both
brevity and obscurity.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Q. Curtius Rufus.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The doubts which have always been entertained respecting
the time when the biographer of Alexander the Great flourished,
and which no investigations have been sufficient to dissipate,
render it impossible to pass him by unnoticed, although he may,
perhaps, belong to an age beyond the chronological limits of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>this work. The purity of his style has, in the opinion of some
critics, entitled him to a place among the writers of the silver
age; whilst Niebuhr, judging by the internal evidence, thinks
that he must have lived as late as the reign of Caracalla or Septimius
Severus.</p>

<p class='c011'>No valid argument, however, can be based upon his style,
because it is evidently artificial: it is, indeed, infected with a
love of declamatory ornament; it is sometimes more like poetry
than prose; it abounds in metaphors, and therefore proves that
he lived in a rhetorical age; but it is upon the whole an imitation
of the Latinity of Livy. This rhetorical character of his
style gives some value to the opinion of F. A. Wolf, that he was
the Q. Curtius Rufus mentioned by Suetonius in his treatise on
Illustrious Orators. If so, he was probably a contemporary.</p>

<p class='c011'>With respect to internal evidence, reference has been made
to two passages as containing allusions to his times. (1.) Multis
ergo casibus defuncta (sc. Tyrus,) nunc tamen longa pace cuncta
refovente, sub tutela Romanæ mansuetudinis acquiescit.<a id='r1241' /><a href='#f1241' class='c012'><sup>[1241]</sup></a> (2.)
Proinde jure meritoque P. R. salutem se principi suo debere
profitetur, qui noctis, quam pæne supremam habuimus, novum
sidus illuxit, hujus hercule, non solis ortus, lucem caliganti reddidit
mundo, cum sine suo capite discordia membra trepidarent.<a id='r1242' /><a href='#f1242' class='c012'><sup>[1242]</sup></a>
The former has been considered descriptive of many periods in
Roman history: although Niebuhr<a id='r1243' /><a href='#f1243' class='c012'><sup>[1243]</sup></a> makes the unqualified assertion,
that it has no meaning, unless it alludes to the times of
Septimius Severus and Caracalla. The latter is equally vague:
Niebuhr thinks it might refer to Aurelian: Gibbon considers
that it alluded to Gordian. But to how many Emperors might
a spirit of eulogistic flattery make it applicable! Upon the
whole, it is most probable that he lived towards the close of the
first century.</p>

<p class='c011'>The biography of Alexander is deeply interesting; for,
although Curtius evidently disdains historic reality, his hero
always seems to have a living existence: it is a romance rather
than a history. He never loses an opportunity by the colouring
which he gives to historical facts of elevating the Macedonian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>conqueror to a superhuman standard. He has no inclination to
weigh the merits of conflicting historical testimonies: he selects
that which supports his partial predilections; nor are his talents
for story-telling checked by a profound knowledge of either
tactics or geography, or other objective historical materials, for
correct details in which he is too frequently negligent.<a id='r1244' /><a href='#f1244' class='c012'><sup>[1244]</sup></a> His florid
and ornamented style is suitable to the imaginary orations which
are introduced in the narrative, and which constitute the most
striking portions of the work. The sources from which he derived
his information are various, the principal one being the
account of Alexander’s exploits by the Greek historian Clitarchus,
who accompanied the Macedonian conqueror in his Asiatic
expedition. He is, however, by no means a servile follower;
for in one instance he does not hesitate to accuse him of inaccuracy.
They were, however, kindred spirits: both would sacrifice
truth to romantic interest; both indulged in the same tale-telling
tendency. His work originally consisted of ten books. Two of
these are lost, and their places have been supplied, in a very
inferior manner, by Cellarius and Freinsheim. Even in the
eight books which are extant, an hiatus of more or less extent
occasionally occurs.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>L. Annæus Florus.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Brief as the epitomes are which bear the name of L. Annæus
Florus, the style is characterized by the rhetorical spirit of the
age to which they belong. They are diffuse and declamatory,
and their author is rather the panegyrist of his countrymen than
the grave and sober narrator of the most important events contained
in their history. This short summary, entitled “<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rerum
Romanarum</span></cite>, Libri <span class='fss'>IV.</span>,” or “<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Epitome de Gestis Romanorum</span></cite>,” is
a well-arranged compilation from the authorities extant; but it
is probable that, like all other Roman historians except Velleius
Paterculus, he derived his materials principally from Livy. Such
a dry skeleton of history, however, must be uninteresting. Who
the author was is by no means certain. Some have supposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>him to be the same with Annæus Florus, who wrote three trochaic
verses to Hadrian. Titze<a id='r1245' /><a href='#f1245' class='c012'><sup>[1245]</sup></a> imagines that it is the work of
two authors, one a contemporary of Horace,<a id='r1246' /><a href='#f1246' class='c012'><sup>[1246]</sup></a> the other belonging
to a later literary period.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is generally assumed that the author<a id='r1247' /><a href='#f1247' class='c012'><sup>[1247]</sup></a> of the Epitomes was
either a Spaniard or a Gaul; and, if we may consider the introduction
to the work as genuine, he lived in the reign of Trajan.</p>

</div>
<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>M. Annæus Seneca.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The family of the Senecas exercised a remarkable influence
over literature; they may, in fact, be said to have given the tone
to the taste of their age.</p>

<p class='c011'>M. Annæus Seneca was born at Corduba (Cordova.) The
precise date of his birth is unknown; but Clinton places it about
<span class='sc'>B.&nbsp;C.</span> 61. This is not improbable, for he asserts<a id='r1248' /><a href='#f1248' class='c012'><sup>[1248]</sup></a> that he had
heard all the eminent orators except Cicero, and that he might
have enjoyed that privilege also if the civil wars had not compelled
him to remain in his native country. After this hinderance
was removed by the accession of Augustus he came to Rome, and,
as a professional rhetorician, amassed a considerable fortune.
Subsequently he returned to Cordova, and married Helvia, by
whom he had three sons, of whom L. Annæus Seneca, the philosopher,
was the eldest.</p>

<p class='c011'>He left behind him two works, the composition of which was
the employment of his old age. They are the results of his long
and successful experience as a teacher of rhetoric, the gleanings
of his commonplace book, the stores accumulated by his astonishing
memory, which enabled him to repeat two thousand
unconnected words after once hearing them, and to report literally
any orations which he had heard delivered. They are
valuable as showing how a hollow and artificial system, based
upon the recollection of stock-passages and commonplaces, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>supplanted the natural promptings of true eloquence. They
explain the principles and practice of instruction in the popular
schools of rhetoric, the means by which the absence of natural
endowments could be compensated. They exhibit wit, learning,
ingenuity, and taste to select and admire the best literary specimens
of earlier periods; but it is plain that matter was now
subordinate to form—that the orator was content to borrow the
phraseology of his predecessors in which to clothe sentiments
which he could neither feel nor understand. The ear still
yearned for the language of sincerity, although the heart no
longer throbbed with the ardour of patriotism. It is this want
of conformity of ideas to words which causes the coldness of a
declamatory and florid style. It is a mere representation of
warmth: it disappoints like a mere painted fire.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first work of M. Seneca was entitled <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Controversiæ</span></cite>: it
was divided into ten books, of which, with the exception of
fragments, only the first, second, seventh, eighth, and tenth are
extant. It contains a series of exercises or declamations in
judicial oratory on fictitious cases. The imaginary causes were
probably sketched out by the professor. The students composed
their speeches according to the rules of rhetoric: they were then
corrected, committed to memory, and recited, partly with a view
to practice, partly in order to amuse an admiring audience. The
cases are frequently as puerile as a schoolboy’s theme, sometimes
extravagant and absurd.</p>

<p class='c011'>His other work, the <cite>Suasoriæ</cite>, contains exercises in deliberative
oratory. The subjects of them are taken from the historians
and poets: they are as harmless as tyranny could desire: there
is no danger that languid patriotism should revive, or the empire
be menaced, by such uninteresting discussions. Nor were they
confined to mere students. Public recitations had, since the
days of Juvenal, been one of the crying nuisances of the times.
The poets began it, the rhetoricians followed, and the most absurd
trash was listened to with patience, being ushered into
popular notice by partial flatterers or hired claqueurs.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>L. Annæus Seneca.</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>L. Seneca was born at his father’s native town about the commencement
of the Christian era. He was brought to Rome when
very young, and there studied rhetoric and philosophy. He soon
displayed great talents as a pleader; and by his success is said
to have provoked the jealousy of Caligula. In the reign of
Claudius he was accused by the infamous Messalina of improper
intimacy with Julia, the emperor’s niece, and was accordingly
banished to Corsica.<a id='r1249' /><a href='#f1249' class='c012'><sup>[1249]</sup></a> He solaced his exile with the study of the
Stoic philosophy; and although its severe precepts exercised no
moral influence over his conduct, he not only professed himself
a Stoic, but sincerely imagined that he was one. Eight years
afterwards Agrippina caused his recall,<a id='r1250' /><a href='#f1250' class='c012'><sup>[1250]</sup></a> in order to make him
tutor to her son Nero.</p>

<p class='c011'>His pupil was naturally vicious; and Seneca, though wise and
prudent, was too unscrupulous a man of the world to attempt
the correction of his propensities, or to instil into him high
principles. After the accession of Nero,<a id='r1251' /><a href='#f1251' class='c012'><sup>[1251]</sup></a> Seneca endeavoured
to arrest his depraved career; but it was too late: all he could do
was to put into his mouth specious words of clemency and mercy.
He saw how dangerous was the unprincipled ambition of Agrippina;
and dreadful though it was to sanction parricide, there was
scarcely any other course to be pursued, except the consenting
to her death. When the deed was done, he had the pitiful
meanness to screen the murderer by a falsehood. He wrote a
letter, which Nero sent to the senate, accusing his mother of
treason, and asserting that she had committed suicide.<a id='r1252' /><a href='#f1252' class='c012'><sup>[1252]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Seneca had by usury and legacy-hunting, amassed one of those
enormous fortunes, of which so many instances are met with in
Roman history. This had already exposed him to envy,<a id='r1253' /><a href='#f1253' class='c012'><sup>[1253]</sup></a> and
caused his temporary banishment to the Balearic isles.<a id='r1254' /><a href='#f1254' class='c012'><sup>[1254]</sup></a> But
after that Burrus was dead, who shared his influence over the
Emperor, he felt the dangers of wealth, and offered his property
to Nero.<a id='r1255' /><a href='#f1255' class='c012'><sup>[1255]</sup></a> The Emperor refused; but Seneca retired from public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>life. Being now under the influence of new favourites, Nero
wished to rid himself of Seneca; and although there was no
evidence of his being privy to the conspiracy of Piso, it furnished
a pretext for his destruction.<a id='r1256' /><a href='#f1256' class='c012'><sup>[1256]</sup></a> In adversity his character shone
with brighter lustre. Though he had lived ill, he could die
well. His firmness was the result, not of Stoical indifference,
but of Roman courage. He met the messengers of death without
trembling. His noble wife Paullina determined to die with him.
The veins of both were opened at the same time. The little
blood which remained in his emaciated and enfeebled frame refused
to flow: he suffered excruciating agony: a warm bath was
applied, but in vain; and a draught of poison was equally ineffectual.
At last he was suffocated by the vapour of a stove, and
expired.<a id='r1257' /><a href='#f1257' class='c012'><sup>[1257]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Seneca lived in a perilous atmosphere. The philosophy in
which he believed was hollow, and, being unsuited to his court
life,<a id='r1258' /><a href='#f1258' class='c012'><sup>[1258]</sup></a> he thought it expedient to allow himself some relaxation
from its severity. His rhetorical taste led him to overstate even
his own real convictions; and hence the incongruity of his life
appeared more glaring. He was not insincere; but he had not
firmness to act up to the high moral standard which he proposed
to himself. In his letters, and his treatise “<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Consolatione</span></cite>,”
addressed to Polybius, he even convicts himself of this defect.
He had difficult questions to decide, and had not sufficient moral
principle to lead him in the right course. He was avaricious;
but it was the great sin of his times. Tacitus is not blind to
his weaknesses;<a id='r1259' /><a href='#f1259' class='c012'><sup>[1259]</sup></a> but he estimates his character with more candour
and fairness than Dio.<a id='r1260' /><a href='#f1260' class='c012'><sup>[1260]</sup></a> He is neither a panegyrist nor an
accuser. The education of one who was a brute rather than a
man was a task to the discharge of which no one would have
been equal. He, therefore, retained the influence which he had
not uprightness to command by miserable and sinful expedients.
He had great abilities, and some of the noble qualities of the
old Romans. Had he lived in the days of the Republic he would
have been a great man.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>Seneca was the author of twelve ethical treatises, the best of
which are entitled “<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Providentiâ</span></cite>,” “<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Constantiâ Sapientis</span></cite>,”
and “<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Consolatione</span></cite>.” The latter was addressed to his
mother Helvia, and written during his exile in Corsica. In the
treatise on Providence he discusses the question why, since there
is a Divine Providence, good men are liable to misfortunes.
Although the difficulty is explained by the doctrine that the
remedy, “<i>suicide</i>,” is always in man’s power, it asserts the omnipresence
of the Deity, and the existence of a moral Governor of
the universe.</p>

<p class='c011'>Great as are the inconsistencies in his ethical philosophy (nor
could it be otherwise, as his life was always doing despite to his
moral sense of right and wrong,) his views are generally clear
and practical. In this he was a true Roman; he cared little for
abstract speculation; he did not value, except as subordinate
aids, either mental or natural philosophy. He delighted to inculcate
precepts rather than investigate principles. It is for this
reason that his works are not satisfactory as a whole, whilst
they furnish a rich mine for quotations. The fault which pervades
all Roman philosophy exists in an exaggerated form in
his works: they are ethical digests of didactic precepts; but
there is no system, no developement of new truths. His studies
taught him that general principles are the foundations of morals,
and that casuistry is the application of those principles;<a id='r1261' /><a href='#f1261' class='c012'><sup>[1261]</sup></a> but the
Romans were naturally inclined to be casuists rather than moralists;
and in this preference Seneca went beyond all his countrymen.
He writes like a teacher of youth rather than as a
philosopher; he inculcates, without proof, maxims and instructions,
and impresses them by repetition, as though they recommended
themselves by their intrinsic truthfulness to the consciences
of his hearers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Seneca was always a favourite with Christian writers; he is
in fact a better guide to others than he was to himself. Some
of his sentiments are truly Christian; there is even a tradition
that he was acquainted with St. Paul, and fourteen letters to
that apostle have been, though without grounds, attributed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>him. He may, however, unconsciously have imbibed some of the
principles of Christianity. The gospel had already made great
and rapid strides over the civilized world, and thoughtful minds
may have been enlightened by some of the rays of divine truth
dispersed through the moral atmosphere, just as we are benefited
by the light of the sun, even when its disc is obscured by clouds.</p>

<p class='c011'>His Epistles, of which there are one hundred and twenty-four,
are moral essays in an epistolary form, and are the most delightful
of his works. Although addressed to a disciple named Lucilius,
they are evidently written for the public eye: they are
rich in varied thought, and the reflections flow naturally and
without effort. Letters were perhaps the most appropriate vehicle
for his preceptive philosophy, because such a desultory
style is best adapted to convey isolated and unconnected maxims.
They contain a free and unconstrained picture of his mind. We
see in them how he despised verbal subtleties,<a id='r1262' /><a href='#f1262' class='c012'><sup>[1262]</sup></a> the external
badges of a sect or creed, and insisted that the great end of
science is to learn how to live and how to die.</p>

<p class='c011'>In his old age he wrote seven books on questions connected
with natural phenomena (<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quæstionum Naturalium</span></cite>, Libri vii.)
Why he did so it is impossible to say, since he had so often
argued against the utility of physical studies.<a id='r1263' /><a href='#f1263' class='c012'><sup>[1263]</sup></a> The declamatory
praise which he bestows upon them in this work would lead us
to suppose that it was a mere exercise for amusement and relaxation.
But in this case he is not so inconsistent as might be
supposed—he treats the subject like a moralist, and makes it the
occasion of ethical reflections.<a id='r1264' /><a href='#f1264' class='c012'><sup>[1264]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Once he indulged in the playfulness of satire. He had written
a fulsome funeral oration on Claudius, which Nero delivered in
the midst of laughter and derision; but for this abject flattery
he afterwards made compensation by composing, as a parody on
the apotheosis of the stupid Emperor, the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Apocolocyntosis</span></cite>, or his
metamorphosis into a pumpkin. The pun was good enough, but
the execution miserable.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the style of Seneca we see the result of that false declamatory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>taste of which the works of his father furnish specimens.
Thought was subordinate to expression. The masters of rhetoric
were all in all. His style is too elaborate to please; it is generally
affected, often florid and bombastic: he seems always
striving to produce striking effects, either by antithesis or ornament;
of course he defeats his object, for there is no light and
shade. There is too much sparkle and glitter, too little repose
and simplicity.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>C. Plinius Secundus.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Pliny the Elder was born <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 23, either at Verona<a id='r1265' /><a href='#f1265' class='c012'><sup>[1265]</sup></a> or Novo-Comum<a id='r1266' /><a href='#f1266' class='c012'><sup>[1266]</sup></a>
(Como.) As he possessed estates at the latter town,
and his nephew, the younger Pliny, whom he adopted, was undoubtedly
born there, it was most probably the family residence
and the place of the elder Pliny’s nativity. He was educated
at Rome; and serving Claudius in Germany, employed the opportunities
which this campaign afforded him in travelling.
Afterwards he returned to Rome and practised at the bar; filled
different civil offices, amongst them that of augur, and was subsequently
appointed procurator in Spain.<a id='r1267' /><a href='#f1267' class='c012'><sup>[1267]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Some interesting particulars respecting his life and habits are
contained in a letter of the younger Pliny to his friend Macer,<a id='r1268' /><a href='#f1268' class='c012'><sup>[1268]</sup></a>
illustrative of his studies, his temper, his thirst for knowledge,
and his strict economy of time. The letter is also valuable for
another reason—namely, as giving a catalogue of all the writings
of his uncle. “It is a great satisfaction to me,” he writes, “that
you so constantly and diligently read my uncle’s works, that you
wish to possess them all, and ask me for a list of them. I will
therefore perform the duty of an index; and will also tell you
the order in which they were written.” He then subjoins the
following titles:—(1.) The Art of using the Javelin on Horseback;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>composed when he was commander of cavalry in Germany.
(2.) The Life of his friend Pomponius Secundus. (3.) A History
of all the Wars, twenty in number, which the Romans had carried
on with the Germans. This was commenced during his German
campaign, in obedience to the suggestions of a dream:—“There
appeared to him whilst sleeping the shade of Drusus; commended
his memory to his care, and besought him to rescue it from undeserved
oblivion.” In accordance with his superstitious and
credulous temper, he obeyed the call of his supernatural visitant.
(4.) A treatise on Eloquence, entitled “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Studiosus</span></cite>,” in three
books, but subdivided, on account of its length, into six volumes.
In it he traces the education of an orator from the very cradle.
(5.) Eight books on Grammatical Ambiguity, which he wrote
during the reign of Nero, a period when imperial tyranny rendered
studies of a freer kind too perilous. (6.) Thirty books in
continuation of the History of Aufidius Bassus, dedicated to the
Emperor Titus.<a id='r1269' /><a href='#f1269' class='c012'><sup>[1269]</sup></a> (7.) Thirty-seven books on Natural History—a
work, not only, as Pliny the Younger describes it, as full of
variety as Nature herself, but, as will be shown hereafter, a
treasure-house of the arts, as well as of natural objects.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will wonder,” he continues, “how a man occupied with
official business could have completed so many volumes filled
with such minute information. You will be still more surprised
to learn that he practised sometimes as a pleader; that he died
in his fifty-sixth year; and that the intermediate time was distracted
and interrupted by the friendship of princes and most
important public affairs. But he was a man of vigorous intellect,
incredible application, and unwearied activity. Immediately
after the festival of the Vulcanalia (August 23d,) he used
to begin to study in the dead of the night; in the winter at
one o’clock in the morning, at the latest at two, often at midnight.
No one ever slept so little—sometimes he would snatch
a brief interval of sleep in the midst of his studies. Before
dawn he would wait upon the Emperor, for he also used the
night for transacting business. Thence he proceeded to the
discharge of his official duties; and whatever time remained he
devoted to study.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>“After a light and frugal meal, which, according to the old
fashion, he partook of by day, he would in summer, if he had
any leisure time, recline in the sun whilst a book was read to him,
from which he took notes and made extracts. In fact, he never
read any book without making extracts; for he used to say that
no book was so bad but that some profit could be derived from
it. After sunset he generally took a cold bath, then a slight repast,
and afterwards slept for a very short time. When he
awoke, as if it were a new day, he studied till supper; during
which a book was read, on which he made annotations as the
reading proceeded. I remember that one of his friends interrupted
the reader, because he had mispronounced a word, and
compelled him to repeat it; upon which my uncle asked, ‘Did
you understand him?’ and when he answered in the affirmative,
he continued—‘Why did you interrupt him? we have lost more
than ten lines;’—so frugal was he of his time. In summer he
rose from the supper-table by daylight, in winter at nightfall;
and this custom was a law to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“These were his habits amidst the toils and bustle of a town-life.
In the retirement of the country the bath was the only
interruption to his studies. But only the bath itself, for whilst
he was rubbed and wiped dry, he either dictated to an amanuensis
or had a book read to him. On journeys, as he was then
relieved from all other cares, study was the only employment of
his leisure. He had a precis-writer at his side, with books and
tablets, who in the winter wore gloves, so that his master’s
studies might not be interrupted by the severity of the cold.
For the same reason, when at Rome, he always used a sedan.
I remember once having been chid by him for walking: ‘You
might,’ said he, ‘avoid wasting all this time.’ For he thought
all time was lost which was not devoted to study. By this intense
application he completed so many volumes, and bequeathed
to me, besides, one hundred and sixty rolls of commentaries,
written in the smallest possible hand and on both sides. He used
to say that when he was procurator in Spain, he was offered for
a portion of them 400,000 sesterces (about 3,200<i>l.</i>) by Lartius
Licinius.... I cannot help laughing when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>people call me studious, for, compared with him, I am the idlest
fellow in the world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Pliny perished a martyr to the cause of science, in the terrible
eruption of Vesuvius, which took place in the first year of the
reign of Titus.<a id='r1270' /><a href='#f1270' class='c012'><sup>[1270]</sup></a> Had he been as ardent an original observer in
all other respects, instead of a mere plodding student, and collector,
and transcriber of other men’s observations, his works would
have been less voluminous, but more valuable. The eruption in
which he perished was the first of which there is any record in
history. It is probable that none of any consequence had
occurred before; and that the lava had never before devastated
the smiling slopes and green vineyards which Martial has described.<a id='r1271' /><a href='#f1271' class='c012'><sup>[1271]</sup></a>
The circumstances of his death are thus described by
his nephew<a id='r1272' /><a href='#f1272' class='c012'><sup>[1272]</sup></a> in two letters to Tacitus:—“He was at Misenum, in
command of the fleet. On the 24th of August, about one o’clock
P. M., my mother pointed out to him a cloud of unusual size and
appearance. He had lain in the sunshine, bathed, and taken refreshment,
and was now studying. He forthwith asked for his
shoes; and ascended an eminence from which he could best see
the phenomenon. The distance was too great to know for certain
from what mountain the cloud arose, but it was afterwards ascertained
to be Vesuvius. Its form resembled that of a pine tree
more than anything else. It rose into the air in the form of a
tall trunk, and then diffused itself like spreading branches. The
reason of this I take to be that it was at first carried upwards
by a fresh current of air, which as it grew older and weaker was
unable to support it, or perhaps its own gravity caused it to vanish
in a horizontal direction. Sometimes it was white, sometimes
solid and spotted, according to the quantity of earth and ashes
which it threw up.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The phenomenon appeared to him, as a learned man, deserving
of closer investigation. He ordered a light galley to be
fitted out, and gave me permission to accompany him. I replied
that I preferred studying, and as it chanced he himself had
given me something to write. Just as he was leaving the house
with his note-book in his hand, the troops stationed at Retina, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>village at the foot of the mountain, from which there was no
escape except by sea, alarmed by the imminent peril they were
in, sent to entreat him to rescue them. Notwithstanding this
circumstance his determination was unaltered; but the task
which he had commenced with earnestness he went through with
the greatest resolution.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He launched some quadriremes, and embarked for the purpose
of assisting, not Retina only, but others; for the beauty of
the coast had attracted a large population. He hastened to the
spot whence others were flying, and steered a direct course to
the point of danger, so fearlessly that he observed all the phases
and forms of that sad calamity, and dictated his remarks on
them to his secretary. Soon ashes fell on the decks, and the
nearer he approached the hotter and thicker they became.
With them were mingled scorched and blackened pumice-stones,
and stones split by fire. Now the sudden reflux of the sea, and
the fragments of the volcano which covered the coast, presented
an obstacle to his progress, and he hesitated for awhile whether
he should not return. At length, when his sailing-master
recommended him to do so, he exclaimed, ‘Fortune favours the
brave—steer for the villa of Pomponianus.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“This was situated at Stabiæ, and was divided from the coast
near Vesuvius by an inlet or gulf formed by the sea. His friend,
although danger was not yet imminent, yet, as it was within
sight, and would be very near if it increased, had put his baggage
on board of a ship, and had determined on flight if the wind,
which was then contrary, should lull. A fair wind carried my
uncle thither. He embraced his trembling friend, consoled and
encouraged him. In order to assuage his fears by showing his
own unconcern, he caused himself to be carried to a bath: after
bathing, he sat down to supper with cheerfulness, or, what is
almost the same thing, with the appearance of it. Meanwhile
from many parts of the volcano broad flames burst forth: the
blaze was reflected from the sky, and the glare and brightness
were enhanced by the darkness of the night. He, to soothe the
alarm of Pomponianus, endeavoured to persuade him that what
he saw was only the burning villages which the country people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>had deserted in their consternation. He then retired to rest
and slept soundly; for his snoring, which on account of his
broad chest was deep and resonant, was heard by those who
were watching at the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Soon the court through which there was access to his apartment
was so choked with cinders and pumice that longer delay
would have rendered escape impossible. He was awakened;
and went to Pomponianus and the rest, who had sat up all night.
They then held a consultation whether they should remain in
the house or go into the open fields. For repeated shocks of an
earthquake made the houses rock to and fro, and seemed to move
them from their foundations; whilst in the air the fall of half-burnt
pumice, though light, menaced danger. After balancing
the two dangers, he chose the latter course: with him, however,
it was a comparison of reasons, with others of fears. They tied
cushions over their heads with towels, to protect them from the
falling stones. Although it was now day elsewhere, the darkness
here was denser than the darkest night, broken only by
torches and lights of different kinds. They next walked out to
the coast to see whether the sea was calm enough to venture
upon it, but it was still a waste of stormy waters. Then he
spread a linen cloth and lay down upon it, asked for two or
three draughts of cold water; and, afterwards, flames, and that
sulphureous smell which is the forerunner of them, put his companions
to flight and aroused him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He arose by the assistance of two slaves, and immediately
fell down dead, suffocated as I imagine by the dense vapour, and
the functions of his stomach being disordered, which were naturally
weak, and liable to obstructions and difficulty of digestion.
On the morning of the third day after his body was found entire,
uninjured, and in the clothes in which he died: its appearance
was rather that of sleep than death.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Pliny the Younger was left with his mother at Misenum; and
in another letter he gives an account of the appearance of the
eruption at that place:<a id='r1273' /><a href='#f1273' class='c012'><sup>[1273]</sup></a>—</p>

<p class='c011'>“After my uncle’s departure, I spent some time in study (for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>that was my object in remaining behind:) I then bathed and
supped, and had some broken and restless sleep. For many
days previously shocks of an earthquake had been felt; but they
caused less alarm because they are usual in Campania; but on
that night they were so violent that it was thought they would
not only shake but overturn everything. My mother burst into
my bed-chamber—I was just rising in order to arouse her, in
case she should be asleep. We sat down in the court which
divided the house from the sea. I know not whether to call
this courage or imprudence, for I was only in my eighteenth
year. I asked for a volume of Livy, and began to read it leisurely
and to make extracts.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well! a friend of my uncle came in who had lately arrived
from Spain, and when he saw us sitting together, and me reading,
he rebuked his patience and my ‘insouciance.’ Still I was not
the less for that absorbed in my book. It was now seven o’clock,
and the dawn broke faintly and languidly. The surrounding
buildings were tottering; and the space in which we were, being
limited in extent, there was great reason to fear their fall. We
then resolved to leave town. The populace followed in alarm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When at a sufficient distance from the buildings we halted,
and witnessed many a wonderful and alarming phenomenon.
The carriages which we had ordered to be brought out, although
the ground was very level, rolled in different directions, and
even stones placed under the wheels could not stop them. The
sea ebbed and seemed to be repelled by the earthquake. The
coast certainly had advanced, and detained many marine animals
on dry land. On the other side of the heavens hung a dark and
awful cloud, riven by wreathed and quivering lines of fiery
vapour, in long flashes resembling lightning, but larger. Then
our friend from Spain exclaimed, with eagerness and vehemence,
‘If your relative lives, he doubtless wishes your safety; if he
has perished, he wished you to survive him. Why then do you
delay to escape?’ Our answer was, ‘We will not think of our
own safety so long as we are uncertain of his.’ Without any
more delay he hurried off, and was soon beyond the reach of
danger. Soon the cloud descended to the earth, and brooded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>over the sea; it shrouded Capreæ, and hid from our eyes the
promontory of Misenum. My mother besought, entreated, nay,
commanded me to fly by all means; she felt that, weighed down
by years and infirmity, she should die contented if she had not
been the cause of my death. I, on the other hand, persisted
that I would not seek safety except with her. I took her by
the hand and forced her to go forward. She obeyed reluctantly,
and blamed herself for delaying me. Ashes now began to fall,
though as yet in small quantities. I looked back; behind us
was thick darkness, which poured over the earth like a torrent.
‘Let us turn aside from the road,’ said I, ‘whilst we can see, for
fear we should be thrown down and trampled under foot by the
crowd in the darkness.’ We had scarce time to [think about it]
[sit down] when we were enveloped in darkness, not like that
of a moonless night, or clouds, but like that of a room shut up
when the lights are extinguished. Then were heard the shrieks
of women, the wailings of infants, the shouts of men; some were
calling for their parents, others for their children, others for their
wives, whom they could only recognise by their voices. Some
bewailed their own misfortune, others that of their family; some
even from the fear of death prayed for death. Many lifted up
their hands to the gods; still more believed that there were no
gods, and that the last eternal night had overwhelmed the world.
There were not wanting some to increase the real danger by
fictitious and imaginary terrors; and some brought word that
the conflagration was at Misenum: the false intelligence met
with credence. By degrees the light returned; but it seemed
to us not the return of day, but the indication that the fire was
approaching. Its progress, however, was arrested at some distance:
again darkness succeeded with showers of ashes. Every
now and then we got up and shook them off from us, otherwise
we should have been overwhelmed and bruised by their weight.
I might boast that not a groan or unmanly expression escaped
me in the midst of my dangers, were it not that my firmness was
founded on the consolatory belief that all mankind was involved,
together with myself, in one common ruin. At length the darkness
cleared up, and dispersed like smoke or mist. Real daylight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>succeeded; even the sun shone forth, but with a lurid light as
when eclipsed. The aspect of everything which met our astonished
eyes was changed: ashes covered the ground like a deep
snow. We returned to Misenum, and refreshed ourselves, and
passed an anxious night in alternate hopes and fears: the latter,
however, predominated. The earthquake still continued; and
many, in a state of frenzy, made a mockery of their own and
their neighbours’ misfortunes by terrific prophecies.” The above
letters, though long, have been quoted because they detail, in
the most interesting manner, the circumstances of the elder
Pliny’s death, and at the same time illustrate the simple and
graphic power of the nephew’s pen.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Natural Philosophy of Pliny is, to say the least, an unequalled
monument of studious diligence and persevering industry.
It consists of thirty-seven books, and contains, according to his
own account,<a id='r1274' /><a href='#f1274' class='c012'><sup>[1274]</sup></a> 20,000 facts (as he believed them to be) connected
with nature and art: the result, not of original research, but, as
he honestly confessed, culled from the labours of other men. It
must, however, be allowed that the confused arrangement is
owing partly to the indefinite state of science, and the consequent
mingling together of branches which are separate and
distinct.<a id='r1275' /><a href='#f1275' class='c012'><sup>[1275]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Owing to the extent and variety of his reading, his credulous
love of the marvellous, and his want of judgment in comparing
and selecting, he does not present us with a correct view of the
degree of truth to which science had attained in his own age.
He does not show how one age had corrected the errors of a
preceding one; but reproduces errors, evidently obsolete and inconsistent
with facts and theories which had grown up afterwards
and replaced them.</p>

<p class='c011'>With him mythological traditions appear to have almost the
same authority as modern discoveries. The earth teems with
monsters, not miracles, or exceptions to the regular order of nature,
but specimens of her ingenuity. In his theory of the universe
he assumes such causes and principles as lead him to admit,
without question, the existence of prodigies, however impossible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>they may be. They are wonderful because unusual; but they
are effects which might result from the natural causes which he
believed to be in operation. His theory, that Nature acted not
only by regular laws but often by actual interferences, (for this
was the character of his pantheism, ii. 5, 7,)—his belief that the
various germs of created things were scattered in profusion
throughout the universe, and accidentally mingling in confusion
produced monstrous forms, (3)—prepared him to consider nothing
incredible (xi. 3;) and his temper inclined him to go further,
and to admit almost every thing which was credible as true.<a id='r1276' /><a href='#f1276' class='c012'><sup>[1276]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Deficient as the work is in scientific value and philosophical
arrangement, the author evidently wished to stamp it with a
character of practical utility. It is an encyclopædia of the knowledge
which could be brought together from different sources;
and for such a work there are two important requisites—facility
of reference, and the citation of authorities. With this view the
whole is preceded by a summary, and to each book is added a
table of contents, together with the names of authors to whom
he is indebted.</p>

<p class='c011'>The work commences with the theory of the universe;<a id='r1277' /><a href='#f1277' class='c012'><sup>[1277]</sup></a> the
history and science of astronomy; meteorological phenomena;
and the geological changes which have taken place on the earth
by volcanic and aqueous action. Geography, both physical and
political, occupy the four next books.<a id='r1278' /><a href='#f1278' class='c012'><sup>[1278]</sup></a> Here truth and error are
mingled in dire confusion. Accounts which are based solely on
the traditions of remote antiquity are given side by side with the
results of modern investigation, and yet no distinction is drawn
as to authenticity; and, owing to his confusing together such
different accounts, measurements and distances are generally
wrong.</p>

<p class='c011'>But in the zoological division of the work, which next follows,<a id='r1279' /><a href='#f1279' class='c012'><sup>[1279]</sup></a>
he gives unrestrained scope to his credulity and love of the marvellous.
He tells of men whose feet were turned backwards;
of others whose feet were so large as to shade them when they
lay in the sun. He describes beings in whom both sexes were
united; others in whom a change of sex had taken place; others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>without mouths, who fed on the fragrance of fruits and flowers.<a id='r1280' /><a href='#f1280' class='c012'><sup>[1280]</sup></a>
Such are some of the marvels of the human race recorded by him.
Amongst the lower animals he enumerates horned horses furnished
with wings;<a id='r1281' /><a href='#f1281' class='c012'><sup>[1281]</sup></a> the Mantichora, with the face of a man, three
rows of teeth, a lion’s body, and a scorpion’s tail;<a id='r1282' /><a href='#f1282' class='c012'><sup>[1282]</sup></a> the unicorn
with a stag’s head, a horse’s body, the feet of an elephant, and
the tail of a boar;<a id='r1283' /><a href='#f1283' class='c012'><sup>[1283]</sup></a> the basilisk, whose very glance is fatal.
The seas are peopled not only with sea-goats and sea-elephants,
but with real Nereids and Tritons.<a id='r1284' /><a href='#f1284' class='c012'><sup>[1284]</sup></a> Mice, according to his account,
produce their young by licking each other; and fire produces
an insect (pyralis) which cannot live except in the midst
of the flames.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sixteen books<a id='r1285' /><a href='#f1285' class='c012'><sup>[1285]</sup></a> are devoted to botany, both general and medical;
and the medicinal properties of the human frame, and of
other animal substances, as well as of different waters, are next
discussed.<a id='r1286' /><a href='#f1286' class='c012'><sup>[1286]</sup></a> An account of minerals and metals concludes the
work; and this portion embraces an account of their various
uses in the fine arts, intermingled with interesting anecdotes and
histories of art and artists. This is the most valuable as well
as the most pleasing section of the work.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was pre-eminently a collector of stories and anecdotes and
supposed facts, and he was only accidentally a naturalist, because
natural history furnished the most extensive variety of marvellous
and curious materials. The naturalist, Cuvier,<a id='r1287' /><a href='#f1287' class='c012'><sup>[1287]</sup></a> observed
his want of judgment, his credulity, his defective arrangement,
and the inappropriate nature of his observations. Notwithstanding
all these faults this elaborate work contains many
valuable truths, much entertaining information, and the style in
which it is written is, when not too florid, full of vigour and expression.
The philosophical belief can scarcely be considered
that of any particular school, although tinctured by the prevalent
Stoicism of the day; but its pervading character is querulous
and melancholy. Believing that nature is an all-powerful
principle, and the world or universe itself, instinct with Deity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>he saw more of evil than of good in the Divine dispensations;
and the result was a gloomy and discontented pantheism.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Pliny the Younger</span> (<span class='fss'>BORN A. D.</span> 61.)</h4>

<p class='c018'>C. Plinius Cæcilius Secundus was sister’s son to the elder
Pliny. Most of the information which we possess respecting
his life and character is derived from his letters. He was born
at Novo-Comum, on the Lake Larius (Como;) and as he was in
his eighteenth year<a id='r1288' /><a href='#f1288' class='c012'><sup>[1288]</sup></a> at the time of the eruption of Vesuvius,
which took place <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 79, the date of his birth must have been
<span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 61.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the death of his father, C. Cæcilius, he was adopted by
his uncle, and therefore took the name of Plinius. He was
educated under the guardianship of Virginius Rufus, who felt
for him the affection of a parent. The regard was evidently
mutual. “I loved him,” writes Pliny to Voconius,<a id='r1289' /><a href='#f1289' class='c012'><sup>[1289]</sup></a> with that
tenderness which so frequently adorns his letters, especially
those to his wife Calphurnia, “as much as I admired him;” and
he thus concludes his letter: “I had wished to write to you on
many other subjects, but my thoughts are fully occupied on this
one subject of contemplation. I see, I think of no one but Virginius.
In fancy I seem to hear his voice, to address him, to
hold him in my arms. We may perhaps have, and shall continue
to have, men equal to him in virtue, but no one equal to
him in glory.” In belles-lettres and eloquence<a id='r1290' /><a href='#f1290' class='c012'><sup>[1290]</sup></a> he attended
constantly the lectures of Quintilian and Nicetes Sacerdos, of
whom favourable mention is made by Seneca.<a id='r1291' /><a href='#f1291' class='c012'><sup>[1291]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Under the care of such tutors and such an uncle, his literary
tastes were cultivated early, and before he had completed his
fifteenth year he gave proof of his love of poetry, by writing
what he modestly says <i>was called</i> a Greek tragedy. This taste
for poetry remained to him in after life: once when weather-bound
at the island of Icaria, he celebrated the event in an elegiac
poem. He wrote hexameters, of which he gives a short specimen,
and also a birth-day ode in hendecasyllables, and he tells
us he wrote with quickness and facility.<a id='r1292' /><a href='#f1292' class='c012'><sup>[1292]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>He was called to the bar in his nineteenth year, and attained
great celebrity as a pleader.<a id='r1293' /><a href='#f1293' class='c012'><sup>[1293]</sup></a> He stood high in favour with
Trajan; and filled with distinction high offices, both military and
civil. He was military tribune in Syria; and besides being
prætor and consul at home, he served as procurator of the province
of Bithynia abroad. He was gentle, liberal, refined, and
benevolent; and his zeal for the interests of literature, and
his wish that the youths of Como might not be forced to resort
to Milan for education, but might owe that blessing to their
native place,<a id='r1294' /><a href='#f1294' class='c012'><sup>[1294]</sup></a> led him to offer help in founding a school, in forming
a public library, and in establishing exhibitions for ingenuous
students.<a id='r1295' /><a href='#f1295' class='c012'><sup>[1295]</sup></a> He thought with justice, such acts of munificence
nobler than gaudy spectacles and barbarous shows of gladiators.</p>

<p class='c011'>His works consist of a Panegyric on Trajan and a collection
of Letters in ten books. The Panegyric is a piece of courtly
flattery, for the fulsomeness of which the only defence which
can be made, is the cringing and fawning manners of his times.
It was written and delivered in the year in which he was consul.<a id='r1296' /><a href='#f1296' class='c012'><sup>[1296]</sup></a>
The Letters are very valuable, not only for the insight which
they give into his own character, but also into the manners and
modes of thought of his illustrious contemporaries, as well as
the politics of the day. Many of them bear evident marks of
having been expressly intended for publication. This of course
detracts from their value as fresh and truthful exponents of the
writer’s thoughts, which all letters ought to be; but they are
most delightful to read, and for liveliness, descriptive power,
elegance and simplicity of style, are scarcely inferior to those
of Cicero, whom he evidently took for his model.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tenth book, which consists of his despatches to Trajan,
together with the Emperor’s rescripts, will be read with the
greatest interest; and the notices of public affairs contained in
them are most valuable to the historian. The despatch respecting
the Christians, written from Bithynia, <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 104, and the Emperor’s
answer,<a id='r1297' /><a href='#f1297' class='c012'><sup>[1297]</sup></a> are well worthy of transcription; both because
reference is so often made to them, and because they throw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>light upon the marvellous and rapid propagation of the gospel;
the manners of the early Christians; the treatment to which
their constancy exposed them, even under favourable circumstances,
and the severe jealousy with which even a governor of
mild and gentle temper thought it his duty to regard them.
“It is my constant practice, sire, to refer to you all subjects on
which I entertain doubt. For who is better able to direct my hesitation
or to instruct my ignorance? I have never been present
at the trials of Christians, and therefore I do not know in what
way, or to what extent, it is usual to question or to punish them.
I have also felt no small difficulty in deciding whether age
should make any difference, or whether those of the tenderest
and those of mature years should be treated alike; whether
pardon should be accorded to repentance, or whether, where a
man has once been a Christian, recantation should profit him;
whether, if the name of Christian does not imply criminality,
still the crimes peculiarly belonging to the name should be punished.
Meanwhile, in the case of those against whom informations
have been laid before me, I have pursued the following
line of conduct. I have put to them, personally, the question
whether they were Christians. If they confessed, I interrogated
them a second and third time, and threatened them with
punishment. If they still persevered, I ordered their commitment;
for I had no doubt whatever that, whatever they confessed,
at any rate dogged and inflexible obstinacy deserved
to be punished. There were others who displayed similar
madness; but, as they were Roman citizens, I ordered them to
be sent back to the city. Soon persecution itself, as is generally
the case, caused the crime to spread, and it appeared in new
forms. An anonymous information was laid against a large
number of persons, but they deny that they are, or ever have
been, Christians. As they invoked the gods, repeating the form
after me, and offered prayers, together with incense and wine,
to your image, which I had ordered to be brought, together with
those of the deities, and besides cursed Christ, whilst those who
are true Christians, it is said, cannot be compelled to do any one
of these things, I thought it right to set them at liberty. Others,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>when accused by an informer, confessed that they were Christians,
and soon after denied the fact; they said they had been, but had
ceased to be, some three, some more, not a few even twenty
years previously. All these worshipped your image and those
of the gods, and cursed Christ. But they affirmed that the sum
total of their fault or their error was, that they were accustomed
to assemble on a fixed day before dawn, and sing an antiphonal
hymn to Christ as God: that they bound themselves by an oath,
not to the commission of any wickedness, but to abstain from
theft, robbery, and adultery; never to break a promise, or to
deny a deposit when it was demanded back. When these ceremonies
were concluded, it was their custom to depart, and again
assemble together to take food harmlessly and in common. That
after my proclamation, in which, in obedience to your command,
I had forbidden associations, they had desisted from this practice.
For these reasons I the more thought it necessary to investigate
the real truth, by putting to the torture two maidens,
who were called deaconesses; but I discovered nothing but a
perverse and excessive superstition. I have therefore deferred
taking cognizance of the matter until I had consulted you. For
it seemed to me a case requiring advice, especially on account
of the number of those in peril. For many of every age, sex,
and rank, are and will continue to be called in question. The
infection, in fact, has spread not only through the cities, but also
through the villages and open country; but it seems that its
progress can be arrested. At any rate, it is clear that the
temples which were almost deserted begin to be frequented;
and solemn sacrifices, which had been long intermitted, are
again performed, and victims are being sold everywhere, for
which up to this time a purchaser could rarely be found. It is
therefore easy to conceive that crowds might be reclaimed if an
opportunity for repentance were given.”</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Trajan to Pliny.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>“In sifting the cases of those who have been indicted on
the charge of Christianity, you have adopted, my dear Secundus,
the right course of proceeding; for no certain rule can be laid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>down which will meet all cases. They must not be sought after,
but if they are informed against and convicted, they must be
punished; with this proviso, however, that if any one denies
that he is a Christian, and proves the point by offering prayers
to our deities, notwithstanding the suspicions under which he has
laboured, he shall be pardoned on his repentance. On no account
should any anonymous charge be attended to, for it would be
the worst possible precedent, and is inconsistent with the habits
of our times.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Pliny’s accurate and judicious mind, his political and administrative
prudence, his taste for the beautiful, his power of description,
his unrivalled neatness, his skill in investing with a
peculiar interest every subject he takes in hand, may be amply
proved by a perusal of his Letters. His touches are neither too
many nor too few. A mere note of thanks for a present of
thrushes<a id='r1298' /><a href='#f1298' class='c012'><sup>[1298]</sup></a> shows as much skill, in its way, as his numerous elaborate
despatches to the Emperor.<a id='r1299' /><a href='#f1299' class='c012'><sup>[1299]</sup></a> His brief biographical notice
of Silius Italicus contains, in a few short sentences, all that can
be said favourably of the life and character of his correspondent.
The sympathy which he felt for his friends, as well as the delicacy
of his panegyric, are exhibited in the few lines which he
penned to Germinius on the death of the wife of Macrinus;<a id='r1300' /><a href='#f1300' class='c012'><sup>[1300]</sup></a> his
honesty in the case of the inheritance of Pomponia;<a id='r1301' /><a href='#f1301' class='c012'><sup>[1301]</sup></a> his legal
skill in passages too numerous to specify; his descriptive power
in the narrative of the eruption of Vesuvius,<a id='r1302' /><a href='#f1302' class='c012'><sup>[1302]</sup></a> in which his uncle
perished; and in the full and minute description of his villa, its
rooms, furniture, works of art, garden, and surrounding scenery.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>M. Fabius Quintilianus.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>In this peculiarly rhetorical age, the most distinguished teacher
of rhetoric was M. Fabius Quintilianus. He attempted to restore
a purer and more classical taste; and although to a certain extent
he was successful, the effect which he produced was only
temporary. He was, like Martial, a Spaniard, born<a id='r1303' /><a href='#f1303' class='c012'><sup>[1303]</sup></a> at Calagurris,
the modern Calahorra.<a id='r1304' /><a href='#f1304' class='c012'><sup>[1304]</sup></a> At an early age he came to
Rome, and had the advantage of hearing the celebrated orators
Domitius Afer and Julius Africanus, whose eloquence he considered
superior to that of their contemporaries.<a id='r1305' /><a href='#f1305' class='c012'><sup>[1305]</sup></a> How long he
remained at Rome is uncertain; but he appears to have gone
back to his native country, and then returned to the capital together
with the Emperor Galba.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although he practised as a pleader, he was far more eminent
as an instructor. Domitian intrusted to him the education of
his two great-nephews;<a id='r1306' /><a href='#f1306' class='c012'><sup>[1306]</sup></a> and the younger Pliny was also one of
his pupils.<a id='r1307' /><a href='#f1307' class='c012'><sup>[1307]</sup></a> The Emperor’s favour conferred on him that reward
to which Juvenal alludes in the following lines:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c022'>and besides this he held one of the professorships which were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>endowed by Vespasian with 100,000 sestertia per annum (800<i>l.</i><a id='r1309' /><a href='#f1309' class='c012'><sup>[1309]</sup></a>)
He thus formed an exception to the larger number of instructors
and grammarians who swarmed in Rome, who, depending on the
fees of their pupils, earned a precarious subsistence,<a id='r1310' /><a href='#f1310' class='c012'><sup>[1310]</sup></a> and was
even able to purchase estates and accumulate property.</p>

<p class='c011'>But though more fortunate than many deserving members of
his profession, he was not esteemed a wealthy man by the rich
and luxurious Romans of his day; for his grateful pupil, Pliny,
when he presented him with 400<i>l.</i> towards his daughter’s portion,
spoke of him as a man of moderate means.<a id='r1311' /><a href='#f1311' class='c012'><sup>[1311]</sup></a> His expressions
are:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te porro, animo beatissimum, modicum facultatibus scio</span>.”
The probability is that he was twice married. His first wife
died at the early age of nineteen, leaving two sons, of whom
death bereaved him in a few years.<a id='r1312' /><a href='#f1312' class='c012'><sup>[1312]</sup></a> For the instruction of the
elder of these, who survived his younger brother for but a short
time, he wrote his great work. His second wife was the daughter
of one Tutilius, and the fruit of this marriage was an only daughter
who married Nonius Celer, and to whom the liberal present
of Pliny was made. For twenty years he discharged the duties
of his professorship, and then retired from active life; and died,
as is generally supposed, about <span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 118. His countryman,
Martial,<a id='r1313' /><a href='#f1313' class='c012'><sup>[1313]</sup></a> speaks of him as the glory of the Roman bar, and the
head of his profession as an instructor:—</p>

<p class='c011'>Quintilian’s great work is entitled <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Institutiones Oratoriæ</span></cite>, or
a complete instruction in the art of oratory: and in it he shows
himself far superior to Cicero as a teacher, although he was inferior
to him as an orator. The rhetorical works of the great
orator will not, in point of fulness and completeness, bear a comparison
with the elaborate treatise of Quintilian. When engaged
in its composition he had retired from the duties of a
public professor, and was only occupied, as he himself states,<a id='r1315' /><a href='#f1315' class='c012'><sup>[1315]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>with his duties as tutor to the great-nephew of Domitian. He
professes to have undertaken the task reluctantly, and at the
earnest solicitations of his friends. He thought that the ground
was already pre-occupied, both by Greek and Latin writers of
eminence. But seeing how wide the field was, and that such a
work must treat of all those qualifications without which no one
can be an orator, he complied with their entreaties, and dedicated
his book to his friend Marcellus Victorius, as a token of
his regard, and a useful contribution towards the education of
his son. Two rhetorical treatises had already appeared under
his name, but not published by himself. One consisted of a lecture
which occupied two days in delivery; the other a longer
course: and both had been taken down in notes, and given to
the public, as he says, by his excellent but too partial pupils:
(boni juvenes, sed nimium amantes mei.<a id='r1316' /><a href='#f1316' class='c012'><sup>[1316]</sup></a>)</p>

<p class='c011'>On the Institutiones he professes to have expended the greatest
pains and labour. He traces the progress of the orator from
the very cradle until he arrives at perfection.<a id='r1317' /><a href='#f1317' class='c012'><sup>[1317]</sup></a> He speaks of
the importance of earliest impressions, of the parental, especially
the maternal care, and illustrates this by the example of Cornelia,
to whom the Gracchi owed their eminence; and brings
forward, as instances of female eloquence, the daughters of Lælius
and Hortensius. He believes that education must commence,
and the tastes be formed, and the moral character be impressed,
even in infancy. The choice, therefore, of a nurse is, in his
opinion, as important, as of early companions, pedagogues, and
instructors.</p>

<p class='c011'>Both on account of the positive good to be acquired, and the
evil resulting from the corrupt state of Roman society which the
boy would thus avoid, he prefers a school to a home education.<a id='r1318' /><a href='#f1318' class='c012'><sup>[1318]</sup></a>
As we consider the classical languages the best preparation for
the study of the vernacular tongue,<a id='r1319' /><a href='#f1319' class='c012'><sup>[1319]</sup></a> so he lays down as an axiom
that education in Greek literature should precede Latin. Grammar<a id='r1320' /><a href='#f1320' class='c012'><sup>[1320]</sup></a>
is to be the foundation of education, together with its
subdivisions, declension, construction,<a id='r1321' /><a href='#f1321' class='c012'><sup>[1321]</sup></a> orthography,<a id='r1322' /><a href='#f1322' class='c012'><sup>[1322]</sup></a> the use of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>words,<a id='r1323' /><a href='#f1323' class='c012'><sup>[1323]</sup></a> rhythm, metre, the beauties and faults of style,<a id='r1324' /><a href='#f1324' class='c012'><sup>[1324]</sup></a> reading,<a id='r1325' /><a href='#f1325' class='c012'><sup>[1325]</sup></a>

<p class='c011'>Primary education being completed, the young student is to
be transferred to the care of the rhetorician.<a id='r1328' /><a href='#f1328' class='c012'><sup>[1328]</sup></a> The choice of
a proper instructor,<a id='r1329' /><a href='#f1329' class='c012'><sup>[1329]</sup></a> as well as his duties and character,<a id='r1330' /><a href='#f1330' class='c012'><sup>[1330]</sup></a> are
described; the necessary exercises, the reading and study of
orations and histories are recommended,<a id='r1331' /><a href='#f1331' class='c012'><sup>[1331]</sup></a> and the nature, principles,
objects, and utility of oratory are accurately investigated.
In the third book, after a short notice of the principal writers
on rhetoric,<a id='r1332' /><a href='#f1332' class='c012'><sup>[1332]</sup></a> he divides his subject into five parts,<a id='r1333' /><a href='#f1333' class='c012'><sup>[1333]</sup></a> namely,
invention, arrangement, style, memory, both natural and artificial,
and delivery or action. Closely following Aristotle, he
then discusses the three kinds of oratory, the demonstrative,
deliberative, and judicial.<a id='r1334' /><a href='#f1334' class='c012'><sup>[1334]</sup></a> In the fourth, he treats of the
physical divisions of all orations, namely, the exordium,<a id='r1335' /><a href='#f1335' class='c012'><sup>[1335]</sup></a> the
narration,<a id='r1336' /><a href='#f1336' class='c012'><sup>[1336]</sup></a> excursions or digressions,<a id='r1337' /><a href='#f1337' class='c012'><sup>[1337]</sup></a> the question proposed,<a id='r1338' /><a href='#f1338' class='c012'><sup>[1338]</sup></a>
the division of topics.<a id='r1339' /><a href='#f1339' class='c012'><sup>[1339]</sup></a> In that part of his treatise which discusses
the next division, namely, proofs, Aristotle is his chief
guide, as meeting, in his opinion, the universal assent of all mankind.
The sixth book analyzes the peroration, and also discusses
the passions,<a id='r1340' /><a href='#f1340' class='c012'><sup>[1340]</sup></a> moral habits,<a id='r1341' /><a href='#f1341' class='c012'><sup>[1341]</sup></a> ridicule,<a id='r1342' /><a href='#f1342' class='c012'><sup>[1342]</sup></a> and other topics,
which complete the subject of invention. The seventh treats of
arrangement and its kindred topics; the eighth and ninth of
style and its essential qualities, such as perspicuity,<a id='r1343' /><a href='#f1343' class='c012'><sup>[1343]</sup></a> ornament<a id='r1344' /><a href='#f1344' class='c012'><sup>[1344]</sup></a>
tropes,<a id='r1345' /><a href='#f1345' class='c012'><sup>[1345]</sup></a> amplification,<a id='r1346' /><a href='#f1346' class='c012'><sup>[1346]</sup></a> figures of speech.<a id='r1347' /><a href='#f1347' class='c012'><sup>[1347]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Facility, or as we, in common with the Romans, frequently
term it, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">copia verborum</span></i>,”<a id='r1348' /><a href='#f1348' class='c012'><sup>[1348]</sup></a> is the next division of the subject;
and as original invention has already occupied so large a portion
of his work, he now endeavours to guide the student in imitating
the excellencies of the best Greek and Latin writers; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>tells him that the next duty, in point of importance, is to profit
by the inventions of others.<a id='r1349' /><a href='#f1349' class='c012'><sup>[1349]</sup></a> A wide field is thus opened before
him, affording an opportunity for the display of his extensive
learning, his critical taste, his penetrating discrimination, and
his great power of illustration.<a id='r1350' /><a href='#f1350' class='c012'><sup>[1350]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>He passes over in rapid review the whole history of Greek
and Roman literature. His remarks, though brief, are clear and
decided, and are marked with an attractive beauty and sound
judgment, which have stood the test of ages, and recommend
themselves to all who have been distinguished for pure classical
taste. So adroit is he in catching the leading features, that the
portraits of great authors of antiquity, though only sketches
and outlines, stand forth in bold and tangible shape, each exhibiting
marked and distinct characteristics. There are few specimens
of criticism so attractive, so suggestive, and which lay
such hold on the memory, as this portion of the Institutions of
Quintilian. Other subjects are also briefly handled in the tenth
book, such as the necessity of pains and elaborate corrections,
in order to form a polished style.<a id='r1351' /><a href='#f1351' class='c012'><sup>[1351]</sup></a> The choice of materials,<a id='r1352' /><a href='#f1352' class='c012'><sup>[1352]</sup></a>
original thought,<a id='r1353' /><a href='#f1353' class='c012'><sup>[1353]</sup></a> the means of acquiring and perfecting a habit
of extemporaneous speaking.<a id='r1354' /><a href='#f1354' class='c012'><sup>[1354]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The eleventh book is devoted to the subjects of appropriateness,
memory,<a id='r1355' /><a href='#f1355' class='c012'><sup>[1355]</sup></a> and delivery.<a id='r1356' /><a href='#f1356' class='c012'><sup>[1356]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The twelfth opens with what the author designates<a id='r1357' /><a href='#f1357' class='c012'><sup>[1357]</sup></a> as the
most grave and important portion of the whole work, well worthy
of the dignified character of true Roman virtue. Its subject is
the high moral qualifications necessary for a perfect orator.<a id='r1358' /><a href='#f1358' class='c012'><sup>[1358]</sup></a>
Talent, wisdom, learning, eloquence are nothing, if the mind is
distracted and torn asunder by vicious thoughts and depraved
passions.<a id='r1359' /><a href='#f1359' class='c012'><sup>[1359]</sup></a> The orator, therefore, must learn studies by what
his moral character can alone be formed;<a id='r1360' /><a href='#f1360' class='c012'><sup>[1360]</sup></a> he must possess that
firmness of principle which will cause him fearlessly to practise
what he knows. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Neque erit perfectus orator nisi qui honeste
dicere et sciet et audebit.</span>”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>A knowledge of history<a id='r1361' /><a href='#f1361' class='c012'><sup>[1361]</sup></a> and the principles of jurisprudence,<a id='r1362' /><a href='#f1362' class='c012'><sup>[1362]</sup></a>
he also considers indispensably necessary, notwithstanding the
slighting way in which Cicero speaks of the antiquarian learning
of the jurisconsults. Some practical rules<a id='r1363' /><a href='#f1363' class='c012'><sup>[1363]</sup></a> are also added as to
the time of commencing practice in the courts, the rules to be
observed in undertaking causes,<a id='r1364' /><a href='#f1364' class='c012'><sup>[1364]</sup></a> and the cautions to be attended
to in preparing and pleading them.<a id='r1365' /><a href='#f1365' class='c012'><sup>[1365]</sup></a> He deprecates the undertaking
such important duties early, although the call to the bar
at Rome took place as soon as the manly gown was assumed:
tradition spoke of boys clothed with the prætexta pleading.
Cæsar Augustus, at twelve years old, publicly pronounced a
eulogy on his grandmother, as did Tiberius at the early age of
nine over the body of his deceased father.<a id='r1366' /><a href='#f1366' class='c012'><sup>[1366]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Enough has been said to show the fulness and completeness
with which Quintilian has exhausted his subject, and left, as a
monument of his taste and genius, a text-book of the science and
art of nations, as well as a masterly sketch of the eloquence of
antiquity.</p>

<p class='c011'>There have been attributed to Quintilian, besides his great
work, nineteen declamations or judicial speeches relating to
imaginary suits; also one hundred and forty-five sketches of
orations, the remains of a larger collection, consisting of three
hundred and eighty-eight. But there is no evidence in favour
of their being his, and their style seems to show that they were
the work of different authors and different ages. Neither is
there any good reason for considering that the treatise on the
Causes of Corrupt Eloquence is the same as that to which he
alludes in the proëmium to the sixth and the conclusion of the
eighth book<a id='r1367' /><a href='#f1367' class='c012'><sup>[1367]</sup></a> of the Institutions. Indeed, the almost unanimous
opinion of scholars assigns it to Tacitus. His works were discovered
by Poggius, together with those of Silius Italicus and
L. Valerius Flaccus, in the monastery of St. Gall, twenty miles
from Constance, during the sitting of the celebrated ecclesiastical
council.</p>

<p class='c011'>The disposition of Quintilian was as affectionate and tender
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>as his genius was brilliant, and his taste pure. Few passages
throughout the whole range of Latin literature can be compared
to that in which he mourns the loss of his wife and children. It
is the touching eloquence of one who could not write otherwise
than gracefully; and if he murmurs at the divine decrees, it
must be remembered that his dearest hopes were blighted, and
that he had not the hopes, the consolation, or the teaching of a
Christian. “I had a son,” he says, “whose eminent genius deserved
a father’s anxious diligence. I thought that if—which I
might fairly have expected and wished for—death had removed
me from him, I could have left him, as the best inheritance, a
father’s instructions. But by a second blow, a second bereavement,
I have lost the object of my highest hopes, the only comfort
of my declining years. What shall I do now? Of what use can
I suppose myself to be, as the gods have cast me off? It happened
that when I commenced my book on the Causes of Corrupt
Eloquence, I was stricken by a similar blow. It would surely
have been best then to have flung upon the funeral pile—which
was destined prematurely to consume all that bound me to life—my
unlucky work, and the ill-starred fruits of all my toils, and
not to have wearied with new cares a life to which I so unnaturally
clung. For what tender parent would pardon me if I
were able to study any longer, and not hate my firmness of mind,
if I, who survived all my dear ones, could find any employment
for my tongue except to accuse the gods, and to protest that no
Providence looks down upon the affairs of men? If I cannot
say this in reference to my own case, to which no objection can
be made except that I survive, at least I can with reference to
theirs—condemned to an unmerited and untimely grave.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Their mother had before been torn from me, who had given
birth to two sons before she had completed her nineteenth year;
and though her death was a cruel blow to me, to her it was a
happy one. To me the affliction was so crushing, that fortune
could no longer restore me to happiness. For not only did the
exercise of every feminine virtue render her husband’s grief
incurable, but, compared with my own age, she was but a girl,
and therefore her loss may be accounted as that of a child. Still,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>my children survived, and were my joy and comfort, and she
since I survived (a thing unnatural, although she wished it,)
escaped by a precipitate flight the agonies of grief. In my
younger son, who died at five years old, I lost one light of my
eyes. I have no ambition to make much of my misfortunes, or
to exaggerate the reasons which I have for sorrow; would that
I had means of assuaging it! But how can I conceal his lovely
countenance, his endearing talk, his sparkling wit, and (what I
feel can scarcely be believed) his calm and deep solidity of mind?
Had he been another’s child he would have won my love. But
insidious fortune, in order to inflict on me severer anguish, made
him more affectionate to me than to his nurses, his grandmother,
who brought him up, and all who usually gain the attachment
of children of that age.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thankful therefore do I feel for that sorrow in which but a
few months before I was plunged by the loss of his matchless,
his inestimable mother; for my lot was less a subject for tears
than hers was for rejoicing. One only hope, support, and consolation,
had remained in my Quintilian. He had not, like my
younger son, just put forth his early blossoms, but entering on
his tenth year had shown mature and well-set fruit. I swear by
my misfortunes, by the consciousness of my unhappiness, by those
departed spirits, the deities who preside over my grief, that in
him I discerned such vigour of intellect, not only in the acquisition
of learning (and yet in all my extensive experience I never
saw it surpassed,) such a zeal for study, which, as his tutors can
testify, never required pressing, but also such uprightness, filial
affection, refinement, and generosity, as furnished grounds for
apprehending the thunder-stroke which has fallen. For it is
generally observed that a precocious maturity too quickly perishes;
and there is I know not what envious power which deflowers
our brightest hopes, lest we soar higher than human
beings are permitted to soar. He possessed also those gifts
which are accidental—a clear and melodious voice, a sweet pronunciation,
a correct enunciation of every letter both in Greek
and Latin. Such promise did he give of future excellence; but
he possessed also the far higher qualities of constancy, earnestness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>and firmness to bear sorrow and to resist fear. With what
admiration did his physicians contemplate the patience with
which he endured a malady of eight months’ duration! What
consolation did he administer to me in his last moments! When
life and intellect began to fail, his wandering mind dwelt on
literature alone. O! dearest object of my disappointed hopes!
could I behold thy glazing eyes, thy fleeting breath? Could I
embrace thy cold and lifeless form, and live to drink again the
common air? Well do I deserve these agonizing thoughts,
these tortures which I endure!”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Such were the principal writers who adorned and illustrated
the literature of the silver age: it remains only to speak
briefly of those whose works, although of minor interest, must
not be passed over without notice.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Aurelius Cornelius Celsus.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Celsus was the author of many works on various subjects, of
which one, in eight books, on Medicine, is now extant. The
place of his birth and the age at which he flourished are unknown,
but he probably lived in the reign of Tiberius. He
was a man of comprehensive, almost encyclopædic knowledge,
and wrote on philosophy, rhetoric, agriculture, and even strategy.
It has been doubted whether he ever practised medicine,
or was only theoretically acquainted with the subject; but the
independence of his views, the practical as well as the scientific
nature of his instructions, are inconsistent with any hypothesis
except that he had himself patiently watched the phenomena of
morbid action and experimented upon its treatment. Above
all, his knowledge of surgery, and his clear exposition of surgical
operations, necessarily imply that practical experience and
reality of knowledge which never could have been acquired from
books.</p>

<p class='c011'>If we compare the masterly handling of the subject by Celsus
with the history of medicine by Pliny,<a id='r1368' /><a href='#f1368' class='c012'><sup>[1368]</sup></a> it is easy to distinguish
the man of practical and experimental science from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>collector and transcriber of others’ views. His manual of medicine
embraces the following subjects: Diet,<a id='r1369' /><a href='#f1369' class='c012'><sup>[1369]</sup></a> Pathology,<a id='r1370' /><a href='#f1370' class='c012'><sup>[1370]</sup></a> Therapeutics,<a id='r1371' /><a href='#f1371' class='c012'><sup>[1371]</sup></a>
Surgery;<a id='r1372' /><a href='#f1372' class='c012'><sup>[1372]</sup></a> and without entering into its peculiar merits,
a task which could only be performed satisfactorily by a professional
writer, the highest testimony is borne to its merits by the
fact of its being used as a text-book even in the present advanced
state of medical science.</p>

<p class='c011'>The study of medicine has a tendency to predispose the mind
for general scientific investigations in other departments not
immediately connected with it. Hence the medical profession has
numbered amongst its members many men of general scientific
attainments; and Celsus was an example of this versatility. The
taste of the age in which he lived turned his attention also to
polite literature; and to this may be ascribed the Augustan
purity of his style, which gained for him the appellation of “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cicero
Medicorum</span>.”</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Scribonius Largus Designatianus.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The “Cicero of physicians” was followed by Scribonius, an
obsequious court physician, in the reign of Claudius. He was
the author of several works, one of which, a large collection of
prescriptions, is extant. In the language of impious flattery, he
calls the imbecile emperor a god. He is said to have accompanied
him in his expedition to Britain.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Pomponius Mela.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>Pomponius Mela may be considered as the representative of
the Roman geographers. He was a native of Tingentera, a
town in Spain, and lived in the reign of Claudius. His treatise
is entitled, “<cite class='quote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Situ Orbis, Libri iii</span></cite>.” It is systematic and
learned. The stores of information derived from the Greek
geographers are interspersed with entertaining myths and lively
descriptions. The knowledge, however, contained in it is all
taken from books: it is an epitome of former treatises, and is
not enriched by the discoveries of more recent travellers. The
simplicity of the style, and the almost Augustan purity of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>Latinity, prevent even so bare a skeleton and list of facts from
being dry and uninteresting.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>L. Junius Moderatus Columella.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The didactic work of Columella gives, in smooth and fluent,
though somewhat too diffuse, a style, the fullest and completest
information on practical agriculture amongst the Romans, in the
first century of the Christian era. Pliny is the only classical
author who mentions him; but he refers to him as a competent
authority. Columella himself informs us that he was born at
Gades (Cadiz,<a id='r1373' /><a href='#f1373' class='c012'><sup>[1373]</sup></a>) and resided at Rome,<a id='r1374' /><a href='#f1374' class='c012'><sup>[1374]</sup></a> but had travelled in Syria
and Cilicia.<a id='r1375' /><a href='#f1375' class='c012'><sup>[1375]</sup></a> It is generally supposed that he died and was
buried at Tarentum.</p>

<p class='c011'>His work, “<cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Re Rusticâ</span></cite>,” is divided into twelve books.
It treats of all subjects connected with the choice and management
of a farm,<a id='r1376' /><a href='#f1376' class='c012'><sup>[1376]</sup></a> the arrangement of farm buildings,<a id='r1377' /><a href='#f1377' class='c012'><sup>[1377]</sup></a> the propagation
and rearing of stock,<a id='r1378' /><a href='#f1378' class='c012'><sup>[1378]</sup></a> the cultivation of fruit trees,<a id='r1379' /><a href='#f1379' class='c012'><sup>[1379]</sup></a> and
household economy.<a id='r1380' /><a href='#f1380' class='c012'><sup>[1380]</sup></a> A calendar is attached to the eleventh
book, pointing out the cosmical risings and settings of the constellations,
which marked the successive seasons for various
labours and other practical points of rustic astronomy. The tenth
book, the subject of which is horticulture, is in hexameters. It
never rises quite to the height of poetry: it is rather metrical
prose, characterized, like the rest of his work, by fluency, and also
expressed in correct versification. The reason which he gives
for this variation from his plan is, that it is intended as supplementary
to the Georgics of Virgil, and that in so doing he
is following the great poet’s own recommendations. In his preface
to his friend Silvinus he thus expresses his intention:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Postulatio
tua pervicit ut poeticis numeris explerem Georgici
carminis omissas partes, quas tamen et ipse Virgilius significaverat
posteris se memorandas relinquere</span>.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><span class='sc'>Sextus Julius Frontinus.</span></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Sex. Jul. Frontinus deserves a place amongst Roman classical
writers as the author of two works, both of which are still extant.
The first, entitled, “<cite class='quote'>Stratagematicon, Libri iv.</cite>,” was a treatise
on military tactics. The form in which he has enunciated his
doctrines is that of precepts and anecdotes of celebrated military
commanders. In this way the necessary preparations for a battle,
the stratagems resorted to in fighting, the rules for conducting
sieges, and the means of maintaining discipline in an army, are
explained and illustrated in a straight-forward and soldier-like
style.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the object which he had in view in adducing his anecdotes
is scientific illustration rather than historic truth, he is not very
particular as to the sources from which his examples are derived.
It is interesting, however, to the antiquarian, if not of practical
utility to the tactician, as displaying the theory and practice of
ancient warfare. This subject had in early times been treated
of by Cato and Cincius, and afterwards by Hyginus in a treatise
on Field Fortification (<i>de Castrametatione</i>,) and also in the epitome
of Vegetius.</p>

<p class='c011'>His other work, which has descended to modern times in a
perfect state, is a descriptive architectural treatise, in two books,
on those wonderful monuments of Roman art, the aqueducts.
But besides these, fragments remain of other works, which assign
Frontinus an important place in the estimation of the student of
Roman history. These are treatises on surveying, and the laws
and customs relating to landed property. They were partly of
a scientific, partly of a jurisprudential character, and are to be
found amongst the works of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agri-mensores</span></i>, or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rei Agrariæ
Scriptores</span></i>. The difficulty and obscurity of everything connected
with Roman agrarian institutions is well known; and every fragment
relating to them is valuable, because of the probability of
its throwing light upon so important a subject. Niebuhr<a id='r1381' /><a href='#f1381' class='c012'><sup>[1381]</sup></a> saw
their value, and pronounced that “the fragments of Frontinus
were the only work amongst the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agri-mensores</span></i> which can be
counted a part of classical literature, or which was composed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>with any legal knowledge.” These fragments, therefore, may
be taken as a favourable specimen of this class of writers,
amongst whom were Siculus Flaccus, Argenius Urbicus, and Hyginus
(Grammaticus.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the life of Frontinus himself very few facts are known.
He was city prætor in the reign of Vespasian,<a id='r1382' /><a href='#f1382' class='c012'><sup>[1382]</sup></a> and succeeded
Cerealis as governor of Britain. He made a successful campaign
against the Silures<a id='r1383' /><a href='#f1383' class='c012'><sup>[1383]</sup></a> (S. Wales,) and was succeeded by Agricola,
<span class='sc'>A.&nbsp;D.</span> 78. He was subsequently <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">curator aquarum</span></i>,<a id='r1384' /><a href='#f1384' class='c012'><sup>[1384]</sup></a> an office which
probably suggested the composition of his practical manual on
aqueducts. He also had a seat in the college of augurs, in which,
after his death,<a id='r1385' /><a href='#f1385' class='c012'><sup>[1385]</sup></a> he was succeeded by the younger Pliny.</p>

<p class='c010'>With this third epoch a history of Roman classical literature
comes to a close. In the silver age taste had gradually but
surely declined; and although the Roman language and literature
shone forth for a time with classic radiance in the writings of
Persius, Juvenal, Quintilian, Tacitus, and the Plinies, nothing
could arrest its fall. In vain emperors endeavoured to encourage
learning by pecuniary rewards and salaried professorships: it
languished together with the death of constitutional freedom,
the extinction of patriotism, and the decay of the national spirit.
Poetry had become declamation. History had degenerated
either into fulsome panegyric, or the fleshless skeletons of epitomes;
and at length Romans seemed to disdain the use of their
native tongue—that tongue which laborious pains had brought
to such a height of polish and perfection, and wrote in Greek,
as they had in the infancy of the national literature, when Latin
was too rude and imperfect to imbody the ideas which they had
derived from their Greek instructors.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Emperor Hadrian resided long at Athens, and became
imbued with a taste and admiration for Greek; and thus the
literature of Rome became Hellenized. From this epoch the
term Classical can no longer be applied to it, for it did not retain
its purity. To Greek influence succeeded the still more corrupting
one of foreign nations. Even with the death of Nerva the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>uninterrupted succession of emperors of Roman or Italian birth
ceased. Trajan himself was a Spaniard; and after him not only
barbarians of every European race, but even Orientals and Africans
were invested with the imperial purple. The empire also
over which they ruled was an unwieldy mass of heterogeneous
materials. The literary influence of the capital was not felt in
the distant portions of the Roman dominions. Schools were
established in the very heart of nations just emerging from barbarism—at
Burdegala (Bourdeaux,) Lugdunum (Lyons,) and
Augusta Trevirorum (Treves;) and, although the blessings of
civilization and intellectual culture were thus distributed far
and wide, still literary taste, as it filtered through the minds of
foreigners, became corrupted, and the language of the imperial
city, exposed to the infectious contact of barbarous idioms, lost
its purity.<a id='r1386' /><a href='#f1386' class='c012'><sup>[1386]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The Latin authors of this period were numerous, and many of
them were Christians; but few had taste to appreciate and imitate
the literature of the Augustan age. The brightest stars
which illuminated the darkness were A. Gellius, L. Apuleius,
T. Petronius Arbiter, the learned author of the Saturnalia; the
Christian ethical philosopher, L. Cœlius Lactantius; and that
poet, in whom the graceful imagination of classical antiquity
seems to have revived, the flattering and courtly Claudian.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. The religion of Rome furnishes many other traces of Etruscan influence:—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title='exempli gratia'>ex.
gr.</abbr></span></i>, the ceremonies of the augurs and haruspices were Etruscan, and
the lituus, or augur’s staff, may be seen on old Etruscan monuments. The
Tuscan Fortune, Nortia, the etymology of whose name (ne-verto) coincides
with that of the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀτροπος</span> (the unchangeable,) had the nails, the emblem
of necessity, as her device; and hence the consul marked the commencement
of the year by driving a nail.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Roman Hymen, the god of marriage, was Talassius; a fact which
illustrates one of the incidents in the tradition which Livy (book i. c. ix.)
adopts respecting the rape of the Sabine virgins.</p>

<p class='c011'>The name Talassius was evidently derived from the Tuscan name Thalna,
or Talana, by which was designated the Juno Pronuba of the Romans, and
the <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἡρη τελειά</span> of the Greeks.</p>

were Roman. Comœdia Togata was again subdivided into Trabeata, or
genteel comedy, and Tabernaria, or low comedy. The Fabulæ Prætextatæ
were historical plays, like those of Shakspeare.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r185'>185</a>. The plot of the Phasma of Menander is as follows:—A woman who has
married a second husband has a daughter concealed in the next house,
with whom she has secret interviews by means of a communication through
the party-wall. In order the better to carry on her clandestine plan, she
pretends that she has intercourse with a supernatural being, who visits her
in answer to her invocations. Her step-son by accident sees the maiden,
and is at first awe-struck, thinking that he had beheld a goddess; but, discovering
the truth, he is captivated with her beauty. A happy marriage,
with the consent of all parties, concludes the play.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r277'>277</a>. The etymology of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σίλλοι</span> is unknown. Casaubon derived the word from
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σιλλαίνειν</span>, to scoff. The probability, however, is that the substantive is the
root of the verb. The invention of the <i>Silli</i> has been ascribed by some to
Xenophanes, the philosopher of Colophon. He was the author of a didactic
poem, and his invectives were directed against the absurd and erroneous
doctrines of his predecessors. Timon, a skeptical philosopher, who lived in
the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus, was undoubtedly the author of Silli.
Some of these are dialogues, in which one of the persons is Xenophanes,
whence perhaps he was erroneously considered the inventor of this kind of
poetry. All the Silli of Timon are epic parodies, and their subject a ludicrous
and skeptical attack on philosophy of every kind. Fragments of Silli
are preserved by Diogenes, Lucilius, and Chrysostom.—Ad. Alex. Orat.

be present, and the spectators were ashamed to make their usual demand

he was distantly related, and thought it an honour to have been born near
Arpinum. He quotes a saying of Pompey’s (Cic. de Leg. ii. 3,) that Arpinum
had produced two citizens who had preserved Italy. Valerius Maximus
thinks that Arpinum, in this respect, enjoyed a singular privilege:—Conspicuæ
felicitatis Arpinum unicum, sive litterarum gloriosissimum contemptorem,
sive abundantissimum fontem intueri velis.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r811'>811</a>. Poverty and barrenness were most probably instrumental in producing
the diffuseness and exuberance of the Asiatic and Rhodian schools. Their
literature and philosophy were deficient in matter, and they sought to hide
this defect by the external ornaments of language. For a long time Athens,
strong in her pure classic taste, successfully resisted this influence; and in
the time of Cicero the tastes of the two schools were in direct opposition.
But the flowers of rhetoric are captivating: another generation saw the supremacy
of rhetoric at Rome; and the days of Petronius Arbiter (Satyr. book
ii.) witnessed the migration of Asiatic taste to Athens.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r812'>812</a>. Cicero tells us (de Orat. i. 57, 58) that Galba, Antony, and Sulpicius
were ignorant of jurisprudence; that the chief requisites were elegance, wit,
pathos, &amp;c. For legal knowledge they trusted to jurisconsults. In the oration
<i>pro Muræna</i>, even he himself sneers at a technical knowledge of law.</p>

anecdote (Suet. V. J. C. 72) characteristic of the most amiable feature in
Cæsar’s character, his devoted and hearty attachment to those whom he
loved. Once, when they were journeying together, they reached a cottage,
in which only one room was to be procured; Oppius was ill, and Cæsar
gave up the room to his sick friend, whilst he bivouacked in the open air.</p>

written in cipher, of which he gives the following interesting description:—“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Erat
conventum inter eos clandestinum de commutando situ literarum ut
inscriptio quidem alia alius locum et nomen teneret sed in legendo locus
cuique suus et potestas restitueretur</span>.” Suetonius (Vit. Cæs. 56) describes in
the same way the nature of the cipher which he used, and illustrates it by
saying that he used to put <i>d</i> for <i>a</i>, and so forth.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
